Vulnerability Type:

Buffer Overflow
 
 
Vulnerability Details:
=========================
Git Windows SVN ssh-agent.exe is vulnerable to buffer overflow. Under cmd dir in Git there is
start-ssh-agent.cmd file used to invoke ssh-agent.exe. This is local attack vector in which if
the "start-ssh-agent.cmd" file is replaced with specially crafted malicious &#039;.cmd&#039; file we cause buffer overflow, code execution may become possible.
 
Fault module seems to be msys-1.0.dll

Payload of 944 bytes to cause seg fault:
@ 948 bytes we completely overwrite EBP register.
@ 972 bytes KABOOOOOOOOOOM! we control EIP.

POC code(s):
===============
 
Python script below to create a malicious &#039;start-ssh-agent.cmd&#039; file that will be renamed
to &#039;ssh_agent_hell.cmd&#039; and moved to the Git/bin directory, once run will cause buffer overflow and overwrite EIP.
 
Save following as ssh-agent-eip.py or whatever, run the script to generate a new malicious &#039;.cmd&#039; file and run it!
