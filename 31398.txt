Vendor:
==========================
http://www.microsoft.com


Product:
===========
Active Directory Federated Services (ADFS)

Active Directory Federation Services, a software component developed by Microsoft, can run on Windows Server operating 
systems to provide users with single sign-on access to systems and applications located across organizational boundaries.


Vulnerability Type:
==========================
Time Based User Enumeration


Vulnerability Details:
=====================

ADFS has an excessively long timeout on authentication requests using the correct domain, but invalid user. This is likely 
due to the time it takes to search the entire AD directory and return a response. Response times vary with use cases seeing 
valid accounts taking only .2 seconds, up to 3 seconds to return an invalid login. However invalid accounts have been seen 
to take 15 seconds to respond.


1) Observe the ADFS URL https://adfs.exampledomain.com/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx?

2) Observe the length of time for an invalid account to return on login attempt (ex 15 seconds) *you must use the valid 
      domain*

3) Observe the length of time for a valid account to return on login attempt (ex 2 seconds) *try domain\administrator or 
      domain\guest*

4) Intercept a request using anything as a valid username and password. Extract the cookie. 

5) Add the cookie value to this PoC https://gist.github.com/binary1985/d778ef59c01fe82026ee2c9660904e3a on line 15.

6) Update the timings within the script to match your tests in step 2 and 3, the goal is to set the command timeout on 
      line 15 to something slightly greater then the timeout observed in step 3, and then update the logic on line 17 
      to something reasonable. Remember invalid accounts take a long time, valid accounts are quick

7) Execute the script, providing the ADFS URL as well as the domain and a user list.
