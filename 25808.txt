Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Pluck, also known as pluck-cms, is an open source content management system, written in the PHP scripting language.
It allows for webpage creation for users with little or no programming experience, and, unlike most content management systems, does not use a database to store its data. Pluck also includes a module system, which allows developers to integrate custom functionality into the system.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A cross site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Pluck v4.7.3 web-application.
The issue allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side browser to web-application requests to execute service functions
via non-expired session credentials.

The cross site request forgery vulnerability is located in the cms `var1` parameter of the `admin.php` module POST method request.
In the absence of a security token an attacker can execute code arbitrary against administrator account to permanenly delete
the pages of the website via panel. Due to the infrastructure the issue becomes more critical without a checkbox to confirm
the delete of any page.



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The csrf web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low user interaction.
