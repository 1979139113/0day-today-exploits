
Level: Critical

Description:

  The Skype debian packege for Skype (even when not installed via their
  offical repo) automatically installs apt configuration that adds
  Microsoft&#039;s apt repo to the system&#039;s package sources.

  That way, Microsoft (or anybody holding their repo&#039;s private key)
  can easily inject malicious packages via regular update and replace
  distro packages w/ their own manipulated ones.

Suggested vendor solution:

  Remove all apt configuration stuff from the .deb.

Operator&#039;s workaround:

  a) remove Skype&#039;s apt config (sources.list entry as well as the
     Microsoft apt key) immediately after installation
  b) unpack and repackage it manually (w/o that apt config) before
     installation on production machines
  c) use apt pinning to restrict the Microsoft repo to only the
     package &#039;skypeforlinux&#039;
  c) only install it in a strictly confined container
