================================
The classic buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the software VUPlayer an attacker can manipulate the bit EIP register in 
order to execute the next instruction of their choice. Attackers are able to for example execute arbitrary codes. The attacker 
includes a large unicode string to overwrite the EIP register of the process. Finally the attacker is able to compromise the 
system process of the active program.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Launch VUPlayer.exe                
2. Run the code in perl and a file format (.pls) will create
3. Click File - Open a playlist 
4. Select the file (.pls)
5. Software will crash with Access violation
6. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability!
