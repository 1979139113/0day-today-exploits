# The vulnerability allows the attacker to disclosure the password of the username for the phone line that connected.
# To exploit the vulnerability and discluse the data we need to access to the &#039;Polycom IP Phone&#039; by this url &#039;http://address/reg_1.htm&#039;.
# Then we can see in the source code by the field &#039;reg.1.auth.password&#039; and then we see the magic! thats is the password for the username by the sip server.
# Now if we already have the sip server, username and password so we can connect to it with any softphone and make our calls.
