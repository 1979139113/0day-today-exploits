BS.Player v2.51 build 1022 Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
===============================================================

Summary: Ever since the very beginning in the year 2000, the
BS.Player&#8482; has been one of
the world's most popular video players. It is popular for many reasons.
One however
should be pointed out: BS.Player&#8482; is the first software movie
player ever to enable
its users to focus on watching the movie instead of dealing with poor
computer
capabilities or running around looking for a proper setting and codec.
Also, it has
very low CPU and RAM requirements.

Desc: BS.Player and its feature Media Library is prone to a buffer overflow
vulnerability because
it fails to adequatly sanitize boundry check when processing mp3 file
and its metadata. When
you load the evil .mp3 file in the Media Library > Audio launched
from bsplayer the application
crashes instantly giving us info that ECX and EIP got overwritten
enabling the attacker to gain full access to the application's memory and
execute arbitrary code.
