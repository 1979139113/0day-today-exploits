Affected Product(s):
====================
ZTE Corporation
Product: ZTE ZXV10 W300 3.1.0c_DR0
 
 
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
 
 
Severity Level:
===============
High
 
 
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A session vulnerability has been discovered in the official ZTE Corporation ZXV10 W300 v3.1.0c_DR0 modem hardware.
The security vulnerability allows remote attackers to block/shutedown or delete network settings and components.
 
The LAN configuration post to /Forms/home_lan_1 and the page  /home_lan_1  that stores the configuration of the router.
Attackers can request via GET method the /Forms/home_lan_1  path and the modem will delete all the LAN configurations automatically. 
The problem is the GET method request with the /Forms/home_lan_1  path that deletes all the configurations. A hard reset is required 
after successful exploitation of the issue.
 
The security risk of the router ui web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0.
Exploitation of the security web vulnerability requires no privilege web-application user account and low user interaction (click link).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in reset of the modem device, shutdown of the network/lan or compromise of running services.
