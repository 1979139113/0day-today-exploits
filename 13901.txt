nginx v0.6.38 Heap Corruption Exploit
=====================================

# Exploit Title: nginx heap corruption
# Date: 08/26/2010
# Author: aaron conole <apconole@yahoo.com>
# Software Link: http://nginx.org/download/nginx-0.6.38.tar.gz
# Version: <= 0.6.38, <= 0.7.61
# Tested on: BT4R1 running nginx 0.6.38 locally
# CVE: 2009-2629
#
# note: this was written and tested against BT4. This means it&#039;s an
#       intel x86 setup (ie: offsets for 32-bit machine, etc.). YMMV
#       also - only tested successfully against nginx 0.6.38
#              you&#039;ll definitely need to modify against other versions
#
# you&#039;ll need to know where the offset is going to land, and what the pad is
# from that point to when you&#039;ve tained execution flow.
#
# A quick way to find out just for verification would be to launch nginx,
# attach GDB to the worker and target it with the exploit, setting the offset
# to 0, or some other arbitrary value. It should crash on a piece of code which
# resembles:
#   if (ctx->offset)
#
# At that point, merely dump the *r; capture the value for the data pointer
# (it&#039;ll be the one with "GET //../Aa0") and add 131 to it (decimal 131 to the
# hex pointer value). That should give you a good area to test with. You might
# want to use the range at that point and set the last octet to 00.
#
# NOTE: you&#039;ll need a configuration with merge_slashes enabled. I haven&#039;t yet
#       found a "magic" combination that would cause the state machine to do
#       what I want to make the bug trigger. Once I do, you can bet BUG will be
#       replaced.
