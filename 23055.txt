Mantis Bug Tracker <= 1.2.17 (ImportXml.php) PHP Code Injection Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.mantisbt.org/


[-] Affected Versions:

All versions from 1.2.0 to 1.2.17.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /plugins/XmlImportExport/ImportXml.php script:

106.  printf( "Processing cross-references for %s issues...", count( $importedIssues ) );
107.  foreach( $importedIssues as $oldId => $newId ) {
108.    $bugData = bug_get( $newId, true );
109.  
111.    $replacement = &#039;"\\1" . $this->getReplacementString( "\\2", "\\3" )&#039;;
112.  
114.    $bugData->update( true, true );
115.  }

User input passed through the "description" field (and the "issuelink" attribute) of the uploaded XML
file when importing data through the Import/Export plugin is not properly sanitized before being used
attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a specially crafted XML file. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability requires the Import/Export plugin to be enabled (disabled by default).


[-] Solution:

Update to version 1.2.18.
