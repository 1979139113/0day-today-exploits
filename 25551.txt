# Exploit Title: Hexchat IRC client - Server name log directory traversal
# Date: 2016-01-26
# Exploit Author: PizzaHatHacker
# Vendor Homepage: https://hexchat.github.io/index.html
# Software Link: https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html
# Version: 2.11.0
# Tested on: HexChat 2.11.0 & Linux (64 bits)
# CVE : CVE-2016-2087

# Vulnerability description #
#############################
&#039;&#039;&#039;
Server Name Directory Traversal in src/common/text.c :
static char * log_create_pathname (char *servname, char *channame, char *netname)
 
In this function, channame (channel name) and netname (network name as 
traversal issues when creating a logfile BUT servname (server-provided
information) is NOT sanitized before possibly being injected into 
the file path via the &#039;log_insert_vars&#039; function call.
 
This bug could be triggered in the special (non-default) configuration
where a user would have :
* Enabled logging (Settings > Preferences > Chatting > Logging)
* Used a pattern containing &#039;%s&#039; in the log filepath (instead 
of the default = &#039;%n\%c.log&#039;).
 
When connecting to a malicious server, Hexchat IRC client may create or modify
arbitrary files on the filesystem with the permissions of the IRC client user
(non-root). For example, the following directories are accessible easily :
* <Hexchat-Conf>/addons : Executable plugin files that are automatically loaded
when starting Hexchat IRC client
* <Hexchat-Conf>/logs : ALL logfiles (from other servers too)
* <Hexchat-Conf>/scrollback : Scrollback text that is automatically 
loaded when entering a channel/server (this may trigger further bugs)
* <Hexchat-Conf>/sounds : Sounds that may be played on demand via CTCP
SOUND messages (this could also trigger further bugs)
* etc.

# Proof of Concept #
####################
&#039;&#039;&#039;
* Install Hexchat IRC Client
* Settings > Preferences > Chatting > Logging : Enable logging and use the log
filepath pattern : &#039;%s\%c.log&#039; (without the quotes)
* Run this Python script on a (server) machine
* Connect to the server running the script
* Results : A &#039;PIZZA&#039; directory will appear in <Hexchat-Conf>/PIZZA instead
of something like <Hexchat-Conf>/logs/___PIZZA
