The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. 
Exploitation requires low user inter action.

1.3
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected in  in the Free Reality v3.1-0.6 web application. The bugs allow remote

remote can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to 
execute the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not expired.
