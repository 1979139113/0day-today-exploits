3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis of Magento Open Source 2 it was
discovered that a lower privileged admin with access to Products
editing can upload a file for a downloadable product using a random
extension (ex. .aaa). Extensions like .html or .php are disallowed
but if the content of the file is HTML the application will serve
the file as such as there is no content disposition header set to
force the download. The attacker can then use the link by enticing
the higher privileged admin to open it.

Unlike a typical XSS which is often limited by length and payload
type, this gives an attacker a whole HTML file to work with.


4. Solution
===========
Vendor fixed the reported security issues and released a new version.
All users are strongly advised to update to the latest available
version.
