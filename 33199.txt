      &#039;Description&#039;    => %q{
        The Cisco UCS Director virtual appliance contains two flaws that can be combined
        and abused by an attacker to achieve remote code execution as root.
        The first one, CVE-2019-1937, is an authentication bypass, that allows the
        attacker to authenticate as an administrator.
        The second one, CVE-2019-1936, is a command injection in a password change form,
        that allows the attacker to inject commands that will execute as root.
        This module combines both vulnerabilities to achieve the unauthenticated command
        injection as root.
        It has been tested with Cisco UCS Director virtual machines 6.6.0 and 6.7.0.
        Note that Cisco also mentions in their advisory that their IMC Supervisor and
        was not tested with those products.
