==========================================================

CVSSv2 Score: 9 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Cacti is prone to a remote command execution vulnerability because the
software fails to adequately sanitize user-suplied input.
Successful attacks can compromise the affected software and possibly
the operating system running Cacti.
The vulnerability can be triggered by any user doing:
1)
Edit or Create a Device with FQDN â€˜NotARealIPAddress;CMD;â€™ (without
single quotes) and Save it.
Edit the Device again and reload any data query already created.
CMD will be executed with Web Server rights.
2)
Edit or Create a Graph Template and use as Vertical Label
â€˜BonsaiSecLabel";CMD; "â€™ (without single quotes) and Save it.
Go to Graph Management section and Select it.
CMD will be executed with Web Server rights.
Note that other properties of a Graph Template might also be affected.

8. Technical Description

8.1 Blind SQL Injection

CVSSv2 Score: 9 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

A Vulnerability has been discovered in Cacti, which can be exploited by
any user to conduct SQL Injection attacks. Input passed via the
â€œexport_item_idâ€ parameter to â€œtemplates_export.phpâ€ script is not
properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary
SQL code.
