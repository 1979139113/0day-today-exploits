Check Point Firewall-1 PKI Web Service HTTP Header Remote Overflow
==================================================================


- Check Point Firewall-1 PKI Web Service HTTP Header Remote Overflow

- Description

The Check Point Firewall-1 PKI Web Service, running by default on TCP
port 18264, is vulnerable to a remote overflow in the handling of very
long HTTP headers. This was discovered during a pen-test where the
client would not allow further analysis and would not provide the full
product/version info. Initial testing indicates the &#039;Authorization&#039;
and &#039;Referer&#039; headers were vulnerable.
