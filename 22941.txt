$owa->setSetting(&#039;base&#039;, &#039;is_remote_event_queue&#039;, true);
$owa->e->debug($_POST);
$raw_event = owa_coreAPI::getRequestParam(&#039;event&#039;);
 
if ( $raw_event ) {
 
    $dispatch = owa_coreAPI::getEventDispatch();
    $event = unserialize( base64_decode( $raw_event ) );
    $owa->e->debug(print_r($event,true));
    $dispatch->asyncNotify($event);
}

Input passed through the “owa_event” POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the unserialize() function at line 47. This could be exploited to change certain configuration options or create a file containing arbitrary PHP code via specially crafted serialized objects.
