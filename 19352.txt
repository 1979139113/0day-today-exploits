Affected version: 1.0

Summary: Cannonbolt Portfolio Manager is a sleek and AJAX based
PHP script to manage projects and showcase.

Desc: The application suffers from a stored cross-site scripting
and a SQL Injection vulnerability when input is passed to the
&#039;cname&#039; POST parameter in &#039;add-category.php&#039; and &#039;cdel&#039; GET parameter
in &#039;del.php&#039; script which is not properly sanitised before being
returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited
to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code or execute
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user&#039;s browser session in context
of an affected site.


Tested on: Apache, PHP
