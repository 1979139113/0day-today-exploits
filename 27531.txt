CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-7237
 
 
 
Security Issue:
================
The Spiceworks TFTP Server, as distributed with Spiceworks Inventory 7.5, allows remote attackers to access the Spiceworks "data\configurations"
directory by leveraging the unauthenticated nature of the TFTP service for all clients who can reach UDP port 69. This allows remote attackers to
overwrite files within the Spiceworks configurations directory, if the targeted file name is known or guessed.
 
Remote attackers who can reach UDP port 69 can also write/upload arbitrary files to the "data\configurations", this can potentially become a
Remote Code Execution vulnerability if for example an executable file e.g. EXE, BAT is dropped, then later accessed and run by an unknowing
Spiceworks user.
