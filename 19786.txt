1º Authenticate and browse to /setup.cgi?next_file=Setup_DDNS.htm
2º All the fields you see are vulnerables to command execution as root, so
inject "qwe.com;cat /etc/passwd> /www/Routercfg.cfg;" into the Hostname
field
3º Everything is done, just download the file /Routercfg.cfg (Authenticated
is requiered)
