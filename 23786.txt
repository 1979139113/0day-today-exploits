# Date: 2015-06-20
# Exploit Author: HexTitan
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.seagate.com/
# Software Link: http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/item/seagate-dashboard-windows-master-dl/
# Version: 4.0.21.0
# Tested on: Windows 8.1 32bit
#
#Description:
#
#The dasboard tool is part of the Seagate software solution for storage. The Dashboard.exe process opens a random port in the 5000-6000 range on each launch.
#
#PoC:
#
#The attached Python script will send 3100 A&#039;s to the target port. This will cause a crash in the Dashboard.exe process.
#
#
#Solution:
#
#Until a fix is available, firewall the Dashboard.exe process.
