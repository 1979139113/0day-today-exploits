# 21526 times (43052 bytes). When triggering this vulnerability, Safari will throw a "Stack Overflow"
# exception, and then an access violation when adjusting the trigger to "A/" repeating 21697 times
# (43394 bytes). The problem originates in the module "WebKit.dll". Safari uses this module as part of the
# WebKit layout engine (www.webkit.org).

# This issue was reported to Apple several months ago and it looks like they fixed it in Safari 4
# (4.1.2 tested) after recent testing. It has also been lying around the Fun Archive @ krakowlabs.com for
# much means that the stack for the process has been exhausted and its maximum size has been reached.
