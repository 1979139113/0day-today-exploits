Product web page: http://www.netluxantivirus.com
Affected version: 1.0.1.8 and 1.0.1.4

Summary: Netlux Antivirus is an award-winning product that provides
and spywares, secures your data, protects your privacy and ensures
your PC remains virus-free.

Desc: The Netlux Antivirus suffers from an unquoted search path issue
impacting the Session Manager Service &#039;NXSessSvc&#039; service for Windows
deployed as part of Netlux Antivirus package. This could potentially
allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would
require the local user to be able to insert their code in the system
root path undetected by the OS or other security applications where it
could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot. If
successful, the local userâ€™s code would execute with the elevated
privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows Ultimate SP1 (EN)
