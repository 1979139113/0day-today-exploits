v11.0 and XG (12.0)*
 
 
OfficeScan protects enterprise networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks.
An integrated solution, OfficeScan consists of the OfficeScan agent program that resides at the endpoint and a server program that
manages all agents. The OfficeScan agent guards the endpoint and reports its security status to the server. The server, through the
web-based management console, makes it easy to set coordinated security policies and deploy updates to every agent.

Host Header Injection
 
 
 
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-14087
 
 
 
Security Issue:
================
Host header injection issue as "db_controller.php" relies on $_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_HOST&#039;] which can be spoofed by client, instead of $_SERVER[&#039;SERVER_NAME&#039;].
In environments where caching is in place by making HTTP GET request with a poisoned HOST header webpages can potentially render arbitrary
links that point to a malicious website.
