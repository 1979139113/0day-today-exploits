Title: Barracuda WAF Internal Development Credential Disclosure


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Barracuda
     Affected Product: Web Application Firewall V360
     Affected Version: Firmware v8.0.1.014
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code, CWE-200: Information Exposure
     Impact: Privileged Access
     Attack vector: Code Review

2. Vulnerability Description

     Firmware reversing of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall
     uncovered development artifacts that should have been removed
     on the production images. Once the encryption scheme was broken,
     many QA and development tools were discovered on the affected
     partitions. Some of these contained sensitive information such
     as authentication credentials used by internal developers.
