Arbitrary File Upload (Path Traversal):
=======================================

It is possible to upload any file to any location on the server.

Proof of Concept:
"Upload Groupkey" functionality allows for uploading any file to any
location on the server. An attacker may use path traversal to store files
in for example cron.d directory and execute them automatically to get root
access on the system.
This vulnerability allows for getting root access on the system from
Admin-User access.
