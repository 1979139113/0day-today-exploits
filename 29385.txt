Affected Product(s):
====================
WpJobBoard



Technical Details & Description:
================================
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious sql commands to compromise the database management system.

The sql-injection web vulnerabilities are located in the `order` and `sort` parameters of the `wpjb-job` and `wpjb-alerts` module 
GET method requests. Remote attackers are able to execute sql commands by performing client-side GET method requests with malicious 
statements via admin.php file. The request method to inject/execute is GET and the attack vector of the issue is located on the 
application-side in the insecure request statement. The issue can be exploited by privileged wp user accounts without user interaction.

The security risk of the sql web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection vulnerabilities requires no user interaction and a privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.
