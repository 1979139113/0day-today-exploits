X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (SiteController.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.x2engine.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

All versions from 2.8 to 4.1.7.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the "actionSendErrorReport" method defined in /protected/controllers/SiteController.php:

153.      public function actionSendErrorReport(){
154.          if(isset($_POST[&#039;report&#039;])){
155.              $errorReport = $_POST[&#039;report&#039;];
156.              $errorReport = unserialize(base64_decode($errorReport));
157.              if(isset($_POST[&#039;email&#039;])){
158.                  $errorReport[&#039;email&#039;] = $_POST[&#039;email&#039;];
159.              }

User input passed through the "report" POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the "unserialize()"
function at line 156. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, and could allow an
attacker to carry out Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and possibly other attacks via specially crafted serialized objects.


[-] Solution:

Apply the vendor patch or update to version 4.2 or later.

X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (FileUploadsFilter.php) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.x2engine.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 4.1.7 and probably prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because of the FileUploadsFilter::EXT_BLACKLIST constant, which is a regular
could be bypassed by uploading a malicious file with capital letters within the extension. This can be
exploited to upload and execute arbitrary PHP scripts if X2Engine is running on a case-insensitive
filesystem or if the web server is configured to handle filesâ€™ extensions in a case-insensitive fashion.


[-] Solution:

Update to version 4.2 or later.
