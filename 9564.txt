MSIE Content-Encoding: deflate memory corruption vulnerability
 
(a.k.a. MSRC 8769, MS09-054, CVE-2009-1547, â€œData Stream Header Corruption Vulnerabilityâ€)
 
Microsoft fixed a bug in Internet Explorerâ€™s â€œContent-Encoding:deflateâ€ implementation. Here are two HTTP replies that trigger the bug:
 
HTTP/.\nContent-Encoding:deflate\r\t\n\r\n\x20\x20
HTTP \nContent-Encoding:deflate\nContent-Range:\n\nâ€
 
The bug allows memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The big surprise (to me at least) is that nobody seems to have found this before even though itâ€™s fairly easy to trigger.
