Introduction

The Mod_Security firewall is one of the most known WAF around, It has
anonline smoke test where we can check if a vector bypassed the regular
Modsecurity setup a challenge for researchers, the challenge was
divided into two parts.

1) Bypassing Modsecurity's Firewall
2) Bypassing MentalJS

Luckily, i managed to bypass both of them.

The modsecurity's rules were very strict, therefore i had to use a browser
bug to crack modsecurity's challenge. The browser bug involved
using seprators just before an event handler. I tried with lots of
seprators, however only /x0b worked for me in this case.

Fix

The ModSecurity has updated the rule set and it now the detects the vector
as an xss vector. Along with that i also provided modsecurity with the list
of seprators that may have allowed for an attacker to create a working
bypass in other browsers too.
