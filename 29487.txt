Ebay Inc.
Product: Magento - Web Application Service 2015 Q4



Technical Details & Description:
================================
SSRF/XSPA vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento Commerce online service web-application.

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to perform malicious server-side requests to compromise the computer system or to 
gain unauthorized access to data or sensitive information. The XSPA & SSRF allows to use the process functionality of the 
magento engine as port scanner for the local or any random remote machine in the same network. The issue is the first documented 
xspa and ssrf issue in the magento service web-applications.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.7.
Exploitation of the ssrf/xspa vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the issue can result in web-server or web-application compromise or unauthorized malicious interactions.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
Remote attackers are able to perform a local scan on the protected web-server firewall to magento.com and magentocommerce.com
