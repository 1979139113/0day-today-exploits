==========================================================


It&#039;s possible edit the users (including the admin account), 
bypassing the authentication through the address:
http://localhost/cuteflow/pages/edituser.php?userid=1&language=pt&sortby=st rLastName&sortdir=ASC&start=1

The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly 
restricting access to the pages/edituser.php script. This can be 
exploited to modify a user&#039;s username and password without having 
proper credentials.
