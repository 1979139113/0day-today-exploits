CVE Reference: CVE-2015-4453
Product: OpenEMR
Vendor: http://www.open-emr.org/
Tested versions: 4.2.0 and 4.2.0 patch 1
Affected versions: 2.8.3 to 4.2.0 patch 1
Status: Fixed by vendor
Reported by: Brian D. Hysell

Details:

A bug in OpenEMR&#039;s implementation of "fake register_globals" in
interface/globals.php allows an attacker to bypass authentication by
sending ignoreAuth=1 as a GET or POST request parameter.

Impact:

An attacker can access sensitive information without a password in
parts of the application that do not disable the fake register_globals
functionality, do not rely on session data initialized during the
login process, and are not governed by access control lists. Notably,
this includes interface/fax/fax_dispatch_newpid.php and
interface/billing/sl_eob_search.php, which contain unpatched SQL
injection vulnerabilities (see CVE-2014-5462).

Remediation:

Apply vendor&#039;s latest patch
