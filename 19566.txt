Details:
========
1.1
A local file include vulnerability is detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows a local privileged user account to include and load local system files. The vulnerability 
is located in the mediaAdmin.php file with the bound vulnerable d parameter request. Successful exploitation of the 
vulnerability results in a web server compromise via file load (webshell) or information disclosure via local system file include.

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] mediaAdmin.php 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] d=


1.2
A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with medium required 
user inter action. The security vulnerability is located in the mediaAdmin.php file with the bound vulnerable 
d parameter request. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side phishing attacks, client 
side malware load, external redirects or stable client side module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s): 
                                [+] mediaAdmin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                                [+] ?id=


1.3
Multiple client side cross site request forgery vulnerabilities are detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to form malicious webpages to execute application functions on client side requests
with not expired application session. The security vulnerabilities are located in the deleteMenu, deleteCategory, deleteArticle, 
addMenu, addCategory & addArticle modules. Successful exploitation can result in forced account add/delete and category/article 
add/delete via not expired application session.


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The local file include vulnerability can be exploited by local privileged user account without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2
The client side cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account 
and with low or medium required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.3
The client side cross site request forgery vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account 
and with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high(-).

1.2
The security risk of the client site cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).

1.3
The security risk of the client site cross site request forgery vulnerabilties are estimated as low(+).
