# Exploit Title: FCrackZip Local Buffer Overflow PoC
# Date: September 5th, 2010
# Author: 0x6264

# Version: 1.0
# Tested on: Ubuntu 10.04
# CVE : None
 
Software Description:
fcrackzip is a zip password cracker, similar to fzc, zipcrack and others.
 
Vulnerability:
FCrackZip does not check the length of the input provided to it when using the &#039;-p&#039; flag to supply an initial password or file used for a dictionary attack.  Passing it a string exceding its buffer size (40) results in an overwrite.
 
Vulnerable Code:
   ----------------------------
            case &#039;p&#039;:
        strcpy (pw, optarg);
        break;
   ----------------------------
 
Proof of Concept:
 
$ ./fcrackzip -p $(python -c &#039;print "A"*44&#039;) file.zip
 
Due to being compiled using canaries the overflow is detected and the process is terminated before the overwrite can take place.
 
Solution:
Replace the function &#039;strcpy (pw, optarg);&#039; with &#039;strncpy (pw, optarg, 40);&#039;  Unlike strcpy(), strncpy() will copy no more than the specified string size(40 in our case).
