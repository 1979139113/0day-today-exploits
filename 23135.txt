Affected Product(s):
====================
Pimcore GmbH
Product: PimCore - Content Management System 3.0 Release Candidate & 2.3.0

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Pimcore v3.0 & v2.3.0 Content Management System. 
The vulnerability allows remote attackers and local privileged user accounts to  inject own sql commands to compromise 
the web-server dbms of pimcore.

The security vulnerability is located in the name value GET method request of the pimcore mysql module.  Remote attackers 
and local privileged user accounts are able to compromise the application service by injection of malicious sql commands. The request 
method to inject the code is GET and the attack vector is on the application-side of the modules. Remote attackers are able to use the 
inner application functions of the class module to perform an execution on the application-side unauthorized through the admin acp. 

The security risk of the sql vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no privileged application user account or a low privileged 
user account without user interaction. Successful exploitation of the sql injection vulnerability results in application and 
web-service or dbms compromise.

Request Method(s):
        [+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] backup/mysql

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] name


Proof of Concept (PoC):
