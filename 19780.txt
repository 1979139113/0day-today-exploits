# PHP Server Monitor is a script that checks whether the servers on your list are up and running on the selected ports.
# It comes with a web based user interface where you can add and remove servers or websites from the MySQL database,
# and you can manage users for each server with a mobile number and email address.
# On the "Add server" page, you can choose
# whether it&#039;s a "service" or a "website":
