/50607_en.html#12
 
II. Impact
 
A specially crafted email can access any file on the Palm Pre WebOS version <=1.1 mobile device and send it to a web site of the attacker&#039;s choice just by viewing the email.
 
III. Details
 
The Palm Pre WebOS 1.1 and lower will parse and execute JavaScript contained in an email it receives. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to read/extract any file and post it to a remote website the attacker controls.
 
One particular file of interest is the "PalmDatabase.db3" file. Having this database file will give an attacker emails, email addresses, contact list information including names, phone numbers, etc. Limitations with binary data have been identified, however viewing binary data such as database files is still simple.
 
Proof of Concept
 
Creating an email with the following JavaScript in it will automatically upload a file of the attacker&#039;s choice to a remote web server:
