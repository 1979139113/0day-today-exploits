 
In JsRuntimeState::setCaller, it saves the current caller in the JsRuntimeState object(rcx+158h in 64-bit). But the garbage collector doesn&#039;t mark this saved value. So it results in a UAF.
 
Unlike in our test environment(Linux), it doesn&#039;t make reliable crashes on Windows. So I used another bug(#1258) to confirm the bug. If the UAF bug doesn&#039;t exist, the "crash" function will not be called(See poc.js).
 
The password of the zip file is "calleruaf"
