## Usage

`./CVE-2020-0796.py servername`




```python
        header[&#039;original_size&#039;] = len(b_data)
        header[&#039;offset&#039;] = 4294967295
```

## About



CVE-2020-0796 is caused by a lack of bounds checking in that offset size, which is directly passed to several subroutines. Passing a large value in will cause a buffer overflow, and crash the kernel. With further work, this could be developed into a RCE exploit.
