 
The ActionScript parameter conversion in the fix for issue 403 (https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/detail?id=403) can sometimes access a parameter on the native stack that is uninitialized.
 
If:
 
mc.swapDepths();
 
 
A PoC is attached, it is a bit finicky and depends a lot on the specific Flash version. It crashes currently in chrome-unstable, by loading crasher2.swf?num=15, and then immediately loading crasher2.swf?num=4. The num parameter shifts the stack (for nums between 0 and 31), so changing it around should lead to crashes in different browsers.
