Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in SourceBans, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against web application users. 

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of input-data passed via the "advSearch" HTTP GET parameter to "/index.php" script when "p" parameter is set to &#039;banlist&#039;. A remote unauthenticated attacker can trick a any user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. 

This vulnerability can be used in an advanced attack to compromise the web application and gain control over services within the local network.
