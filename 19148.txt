
Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the  inoutscripts mobile Inoutmail CMS 2012.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account. The persistent valiation
vulnerabilities are located in the new mail & contacts modules with the bound values to, bcc, cc. The bug can be
exploited by remote attackers. The attacker is sending a malicious mail with vulnerable script code values as content.
The admin or customer is watching the arriving mail and the persistent script code in To or Bcc inputs. The context will
be executed (persistent) when the user,customer or admin is processing to check his mails. A privileged user account can
also use the bug to save it persistent for higher privileged user account exploitation.
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] New Mail
        [+] Contacts
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] To
        [+] Cc
        [+] Bcc
 
 
Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
Insert the demonstration string to the Bcc, Cc & To of the send new mail.
Secound possibility is to send a mail from outside to the inout webmail with the string code values.

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
