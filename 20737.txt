Description:
  - GetSimpleCMS Version 3.2.1 suffers from arbitrary file upload vulnerability which allows an attacker to upload a HTML page.
  - The main reason of this vulnerability is that the application uses a blacklist technique to compare the file aganist mime types and extensions.
  - If the mime type or the extension is in the blacklist array , the application won&#039;t upload it.
  
Exploit:
  - For exploiting this vulnerability we will create a file with mutiple extensions for example "exploit.html.fr"
  - The application will check the mime type and extension of the file which is "fr" aganist the blacklist array mime type and extensions.
  - and ofcourse "fr" extension won&#039;t be in the blacklist array so the application will upload it successfully.
  - The uploaded file will be under the "data/uploads/" folder.
  
Solution:
  - The application should use whitelisting technique which compare the file extensions and mime types aganist
  - acceptable mime types and extensions for more information google for "whitelisting vs blacklisting"
