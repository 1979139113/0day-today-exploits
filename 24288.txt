Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in iTop, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against web application users. iTop is a critical application, which is used to cover the entire set of ITIL processes. Successful attack on this web application may result in critical information exposure, data loss, and even unauthorized access to network infrastructure. 

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of input-data passed via the "title" HTTP GET parameter to "/pages/ajax.render.php" script. A remote unauthenticated attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

This vulnerability can be used in an advanced attack to compromise the web application and gain control over services within the local network. 

A simple exploit below will display a JS popup with "ImmuniWeb" word:

http://[host]/pages/ajax.render.php?operation=render_dashboard&dashboard_id=1&layout_class=DashboardLayoutOneCol&title=%3Cimg%20src=%22x%22%20onerror=javascript:alert%28%27ImmuniWeb%27%29;%3E

Solution:

Update to iTop 2.2.0-2459
