Description
============


Output and stored data will be path to image, title of link, link to image, alternative text to image and storyline text. Controls and options such as image width and height plus some template features to control are available in the Controls Panel.

GIU is Open Source and I welcome the community to add to this project.

The ideology of GIU is to provide a simple use application for end users as well as a robust control panel with adequate administrative operations. Folder structures are designed to display images for viewing of those images as a gallery from a sub folder of your website.
There are lots of controls for the image itself in GIU. The size and position of you image is very important so the Control Panel will give you options to put the image on your page just how you want it. As a theme builder you can add options of you own that will manipulate parts of your theme.

Vulnerability
==============



Direct and unsanitized input via the POST method is fed directly into the MYSQL DB in the register.php file:


mysql_query("INSERT INTO user
A A A  A A A A A A A A A A A A A  (`user_email`,`user_pwd`,`country`,`joined`,`activation_code`,`full_name`)
A A A  A A A  A A A  A A A  A  VALUES
A A A  A A A  A A A  A A A  A  ('$_POST[email]','$md5pass','$_POST[country]',now(),'$activ_code','$_POST[full_name]')") or die(mysql_error());




An attacker could craft SQL commands and execute malicious code resulting in deleting DB entries.
