Total Multimedia Features DoS PoC for Sony Ericsson Phones
==========================================================

Total Multimedia Features DoS PoC for Sony Ericsson Phones.
(Should work on almost all of their Models)
By Aodrulez.
 
   In Sony Ericsson phones(tested on w800i,k750i,w810i),
if you simply rename a File with a ".sest" extension,
it achieves "System" File status.This file can&#039;t be deleted,
nor renamed or edited by any means By the Phone.The only way
to remove or rename those files is to connect the phone to
your Personal Computer & then rename them.
    Folders such as Images Folder,Videos Folder etc,if
renamed in Foldername.sest format, then this folder attains
in it, they become totally invisible.When you try to open these
folders in the phone, it says "No Files in this folder" even when
    Using this Vulnerability, you can totally disable all the
Multimedia features of these phones.
    J2me applications are capable of causing this Filesystem DoS
effect.A PoC of this DoS Function, is the "VooDoo" function of my
J2me File protection application "The Messiah" that am attaching.
