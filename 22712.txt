>> Fix:
Upgrade to OpManager 11.3, then install the patch in https://support.zoho.com/portal/manageengine/helpcenter/articles/servlet-vulnerability-fix
This patch can be applied to all the applications but only for the latest version of each (OpManager 11.3, Social IT 11.0, IT360 10.4).
ManageEngine have indicated that the soon to be released OpManager version 11.4 might not have the fix as the release is almost ready. They are planning to include the fix in OpManager version 11.5 which should be released sometime in late November or December 2014. No indication was given for when fixed versions of IT360 and Social IT Plus will be released.
