This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager and Social IT.
The vulnerability exists in the FileCollector servlet which accepts unauthenticated
file uploads. This module has been tested successfully on OpManager v8.8 - v11.3 and on
version 11.0 of SocialIT for Windows and Linux.

>> Fix:
Upgrade to OpManager 11.3, then install the patch in https://support.zoho.com/portal/manageengine/helpcenter/articles/servlet-vulnerability-fix
This patch can be applied to all the applications but only for the latest version of each (OpManager 11.3, Social IT 11.0, IT360 10.4).
ManageEngine have indicated that the soon to be released OpManager version 11.4 might not have the fix as the release is almost ready. They are planning to include the fix in OpManager version 11.5 which should be released sometime in late November or December 2014. No indication was given for when fixed versions of IT360 and Social IT Plus will be released.
