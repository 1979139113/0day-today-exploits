Description:
An SQL injection exists in Php/Functions/log_function.php, line 933:
$sql3 ="INSERT INTO `${table}_host` SET date=&#039;$date&#039;, host=&#039;&#039;,
hostname=&#039;&#039;, page=&#039;$page&#039;, ref=&#039;$cleanref&#039;, agent=&#039;$agent&#039;,
longIP=&#039;$iplong&#039;";

The $agent variable comes directly from $_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_USER_AGENT&#039;],
without any escaping. This makes SQL injection possible. Even if
multiple statements in one query has been turned off, the contents of
the database can still be read by manipulating the last parameter of the
query (the IPv4-address stored as an integer). For example, the
following spoofed user agent will store the ASCII-value of the second
character of the admin hash as its IP:
Firefox&#039;, longIP=(SELECT ASCII(SUBSTRING(value,2,1)) FROM
phpTrafficA_conf WHERE variable=&#039;adminpassword&#039;) #
This will be displayed in the "Latest visitors > Details" section, and
by repeating this procedure multiple times, the entire admin hash (or
any other database content) can be retrieved.

Partial mitigations:
- - Turn off "multiple statements in one query".
the attacker from obtaining the output of the manipulated query.
- - Apply this quick fix to line 933:
$sql3 ="INSERT INTO `${table}_host` SET date=&#039;$date&#039;, host=&#039;&#039;,
hostname=&#039;&#039;, page=&#039;$page&#039;, ref=&#039;$cleanref&#039;,
agent=&#039;".mysql_real_escape_string($agent)."&#039;, longIP=&#039;$iplong&#039;";

The code-fix does not resolve the SQL injection for all server
configurations, but should be sufficient for most. A proper fix would be
