# Title  : Internet Download Manager All Versions-0day SEH Based Buffer Overflow+Universal.
# Author : Dark-Puzzle (Souhail Hammou)
# Type   : Local 
# Risk   : Critical
# Vendor : Tonec Inc.
# Versions : All versions of IDM are Vulnerable .
# Tested On : Windows XP Service Pack 2 FR 32-bits .
# Date : 14 September 2012
# Gr337ings to : Inj3ct0r Team - Packetstormsecurity.org - Securityfocus.com - Jigsaw - Dark-Soldier ...
# Working On : WinXp SP2 - "Universal" .

#Usage   : Copy this script to idman2.pl
#Execute : perl idman2.pl
#Go to the file bof.txt , Select ALL , then Copy .
# After copying the whole line Go To Downloads ---> Options ----> Dial up / VPN ----> paste the line into the username field and let the password field blank then click Enter .
#French Version : Go to : Telechargement ---> Options ---> Internet ---> then Copy The Whole line from bof.txt and paste it into the username field and let the password field blank then click Enter .

# BETTER COPY THE CONTENT OF THE FILE USING NOTEPAD++
# First Of all , This is a different exploit from (Internet Download Manager - Stack Based Overflow Vulnerability.)
# Second , Script Kiddies will be happy with my latest Idman Vulnerabilities but don&#039;t bother, you may face some problems with the shellcode in this exploit So choose wisely the badchars .

##########Universal Address##############
# I worked on finding a universal address and that&#039;s what I found .
# First you may find some pop r/pop r2/ret / call dword ptr SS:[R+30] addresses in idman.exe Module .
# but The problem here is that all the addr in this module look like this : 0x00ffffff
# So it will terminate the string and the vulnerability will not be executed .
# Ok, the second problem is in idmmkb.dll we found an address "rebase" . As I analysed I found that the rebase goes between "a" and "b" in the address base
# And the Top always stays the same . It will give us in this case two Possibilities 50% of each address to be the correct one in every program execution .
# So All to do here is to try these two addresses manually or using a program .
# The First one :  0x017A1B13
# The Second one : 0x017B1B13
# All you have to do is replace one of these in the "SE Handler" --> $seh .
