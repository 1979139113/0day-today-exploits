Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to ugprade to the latest version available
as soon as possible. Further detailed security tests should be performed
in order to identify potential other security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
The plugin implemented a page redraw AJAX function accessible to anyone
without any authentication.

WordPress shortcode markup in the "shortcode" parameters would be evaluated.
Normally unauthenticated users can't evaluate shortcodes as they are often
sensitive.

Additionally, it is noted that there are other implemented shortcodes that are
being used in this plugin which can be abused through the same attack. Worst,
some of them could lead to remote code execution.


2. Local File Inclusion
The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html
before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because
of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath
variable which then could lead to local file inclusion attack.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
The parameter "shortcode" within the "admin-ajax.php" script is affected by
the code execution vulnerability:

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
[...]

action=woof_redraw_woof&shortcode=<<shortcode without []>>


2. Local File Inclusion
The parameter "shortcode" within the "admin-ajax.php" script is affected by
the local file inclusion vulnerability:

POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
[...]

action=woof_redraw_woof&shortcode=woof_search_options pagepath=/etc/passwd


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
PluginUs.Net WooCommerce Products Filter version 1.1.9 has been tested and
found to be vulnerable.
