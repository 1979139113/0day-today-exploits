The exploit is caused due to a variable named 'update_order' not being
sanitized before being used within an insert into statement.

if ($_REQUEST['do'] == 'update_order')
{
$vbulletin->input->clean_array_gpc('r', array(
'force_read_order'   => TYPE_ARRAY
));

if ($vbulletin->GPC['force_read_order'])
{
foreach ($vbulletin->GPC['force_read_order'] AS $threadid => $order)
{
$db->query_write("
UPDATE " . TABLE_PREFIX . "thread AS thread
SET force_read_order = '$order'
WHERE threadid = '$threadid'
");
}
}
