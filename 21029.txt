The exploit is caused due to a variable named &#039;update_order&#039; not being
sanitized before being used within an insert into statement.

if ($_REQUEST[&#039;do&#039;] == &#039;update_order&#039;)
{
$vbulletin->input->clean_array_gpc(&#039;r&#039;, array(
&#039;force_read_order&#039;   => TYPE_ARRAY
));

if ($vbulletin->GPC[&#039;force_read_order&#039;])
{
foreach ($vbulletin->GPC[&#039;force_read_order&#039;] AS $threadid => $order)
{
$db->query_write("
UPDATE " . TABLE_PREFIX . "thread AS thread
SET force_read_order = &#039;$order&#039;
WHERE threadid = &#039;$threadid&#039;
");
}
}

 You will need Admincp Access then go to
site.com/admincp/force_read_thread.php then in the force read order colum
put a &#039; into one of them to show this
 Database error in vBulletin 4.2.1:

SET force_read_order = &#039;1&#039;&#039;
