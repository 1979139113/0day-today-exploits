Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the password management software Password Safe
and Repository Enterprise violates secure design principles and
insufficiently implements user input validation concerning database
access via SQL statements.

These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to manipulate SQL statements
on the client side using a "malicious client" in order to perform
privilege escalation attacks or to gain authorized read and write
access to other user&#039;s data.

Different SQL statements that are created on the client side in the
context of different functionalities of the password management client
software can be manipulated and thus exploited for such attacks.

These vulnerabilities both affect the online and the offline mode of the
password management software, but there may be different requirements
for a successful exploitation like valid user credentials.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1) Privilege escalation by retrieving information of another user

In order to perform a privilege escalation attack in the online mode
of the password management software Password Safe and Repository
Enterprise from the perspective of an authorized low-privileged user,
the parameter "ID" of the following SQL statement simply has to be
manipulated:

SELECT * FROM tdUsers WHERE ID=<USER ID>

This SQL statement is used by the client software in the online mode for
retrieving user information from the server system after a successful
user login. If the parameter "ID" is set to a valid user ID of another
existing user, for example the built-in administrator account who has
usually the user ID 1, the application can be used with the privileges
of the user with the chosen user ID.


2) Privilege escalation by setting new user rights

Another possibility to perform a privilege escalation attack in the
online mode from the perspective of a low-privileged user is to
manipulate the following SQL statement that is used to update the
user&#039;s last login date:

UPDATE tdUsers SET LastLogin = julianday(&#039;<DATE>&#039;), ChangeDate =
julianday(&#039;<DATE>&#039;) WHERE ID = <USER ID>

By replacing this UPDATE SQL statement by the following one, the user
rights of an arbitrary user can be modified, for example by setting
all available rights:

UPDATE tdUsers SET UserRights =
&#039;11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111&#039; WHERE ID = <USER ID>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The MATESO GmbH released the new software version Password Safe and
Repository Enterprise 8 that is not affected by the described security
issues.

Please contact the manufacturer for further information or support.
