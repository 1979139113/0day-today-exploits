# 1. Description:
# This plugin allows users to thank/like other users threads/posts. 
# In user profiles it shows your most liked post/thread, the post/thread 
# subjects aren&#039;t sanitized to user input.
  
# 2. Proof of Concept:
 
- Use the following as the post/thread subject  <script>alert(&#039;XSS&#039;)</script>
- Get that post/thread liked by another user (or you)
- Visit your profile to see alert.
