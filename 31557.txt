Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2018-009.txt


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Dell
     Affected Product: OpenManage Network Manager
     Affected Version: 6.2.0.51 SP3
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-285: Improper Authorization,
                         CWE-284: Improper Access Control
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: MySQL, HTTP
     CVE ID: CVE-2018-15767, CVE-2018-15768

2. Vulnerability Description

     Dell OpenManage Network Manager exposes a MySQL listener that
     can be accessed with default credentials (CVE-2018-15768). This
     MySQL service is running as the root user, so an attacker can
     exploit this configuration to, e.g., deploy a backdoor and
     escalate privileges into the root account (CVE-2018-15767).


3. Technical Description

     The appliance binds on 3306/mysql using the 0.0.0.0 IP
     address. The default IPTables policy is ACCEPT and the
     rule table is empty. Using any of three default accounts,
     a malicious user can exploit native MySQL functionality to
     place a JSP shell into the directory of a web server on the
     file system and subsequently make calls into it.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor informed KoreLogic that all default passwords can
     be changed and are documented in the OpenManage Network Manager
     Installation Guide. Dell recommends all customers change these
     default passwords upon installation.

     The vendor has addressed these vulnerabilities in version
     6.5.3. Release notes and download instructions can be found at:
