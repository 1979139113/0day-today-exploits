    <!-- FCM-MB40 CSRF to RCE as root, by Aaron Blair (@xorcat) 

Full details: https://xor.cat/2019/06/19/fortinet-forticam-vulns/

Follow the following steps to demonstrate this PoC:

1. Replace IP addresses in Javascript code to repr	esent your testing
   environment.
2. Launch a `netcat` listener on the attacker&#039;s host using `nc -nvlp
   1337`
3. Ensure the "admin" user&#039;s browser is logged in to the FCM-MB40.
   * Note: all modern browsers will cache Basic Authentication
     credentials (such as those used by the FCM-MB40) even if the
     FCM-MB40&#039;s administration page is closed.
4. Open the crafted HTML document using the "admin" user&#039;s
browser. 
   * Note: In an attack scenario, this step would be performed by
     implanting the code into a legitimate webpage that the "admin"
     user visits, or by tricking the "admin" user into opening a page
     which includes the code.
5. Note that the `netcat` listener established in step 2. has received
   session as root.
   * Note: type `id` in the `netcat` connection to verify this.

_Note: After this issue has been exploited, the state of the system will
have changed, and future exploitation attempts may require
modification._
