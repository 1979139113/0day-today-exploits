(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Aug/1) and recent advisory about 
Callisto 821+R3, here is new one. Because vendor ignored in 2011 all my 
letters and subsequent my public disclosure of vulnerabilities and new 
devices are vulnerable as well, so I disclosed vulnerabilities in Callisto 
821+R3 ADSL Router.

These are Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities. The whole control 
panel is vulnerable to CSRF, here are two vulnerabilities.

SecurityVulns ID: 11700.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: Callisto 821+R3, Firmware Version: ZXDSL 
831IIV7.5.1a_E09_UA. This model with other firmware and also other models of 
Callisto also must be vulnerable.

For changing login and password of admin:

http://site/adminpasswd.cgi?action=save&sysUserName=admin&sysPassword=E696D64616
