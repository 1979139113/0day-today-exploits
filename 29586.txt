Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered multiple persistent web vulnerabilities in the official 
CentOS Web Panel v0.9.8.12.


Affected Product(s):
====================
CWP
Product: CentOS Web Panel - (CWP) 0.9.8.12


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent validation web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official CentOS Web Panel v0.9.8.12.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the 
affected vulnerable modules.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `id` and `email_address` parameters of the `index.php` file POST method request. 
Remote attackers are able to inject script code to the POST method request to manipulate the item listing output 
context. 
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is persistent on the application-side. The injection points 
are 
the both add POST method requests and the execution point occurs in the output location of both modules.

The security risk of the web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) 
count of 4.4. 
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities requires a low privileged web-application user account and low user 
interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent 
external redirects 
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
