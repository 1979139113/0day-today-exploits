Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor did not respond to our communication attempts, hence no patch is
available.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security
issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Multiple XSS vulnerabilities
Several pages lack input validation within the URL that is output into the
action attribute of a form. An attacker can break out of the string
and add custom JavaScript events to several forms. Additionally, the error
page also lacks filtering user input / output.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Multiple XSS vulnerabilities
a) XSS in URL for form action attributes

If a victim accesses the following link and enters their credentials, an alert
shows the entered password:

[ removed PoC from advisory ]

Since chars like " or < and > are filtered in this case, a string had to be built
by using char codes and JavaScript&#039;s String.fromCharCode(). The same pattern
works for many other paths too. Following additional paths were also found to be
vulnerable:

[ removed PoC from advisory ]


b) XSS in error page
The internal error page also lacks input/output validation. The following URL
generates a website opening a message box showing the current location without
any filtering:

[ removed PoC from advisory ]
