[-] Attack Vectors:
– Escalation of Privileges: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform hence hijack the Admin’s account and takeover the whole installation.
– Client Side JS Code Execution: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform with a stored XSS attack vector which will lead to execute JS code on behalf of all the user types passing by the attacker’s public user profile page.
– Information Disclosure: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account on Crea8Social platform with a rough stored XSS attack vector to perform client side js code execution on other users sessions hence steal their session cookie or their private information from their accounts.

[-] Fix Suggestion:
Filter and sanitize all the user supplied inputs.
