Vendor:
====================
www.getsymphony.com
 
 
Product:
==================
Symphony CMS v2.6.7
 
Download:

Symphony is a XSLT-powered open source content management system.
 
 
Vulnerability Type:
===================
Session Fixation
 
 
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4309
 
 
Vulnerability Details:
=====================
 
users PHPSESSID "Session Identifier".
If the application is deployed using an insecure setup with PHP.INI
"session.use_only_cookies" not enabled, attackers can then send
victims a link to the vulnerable application with the "PHPSESSID" already
initialized as Symphony does not use or call
"session_regenerate_id()" upon successful user authentication.
 
Note: as per php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php
"session.use_only_cookies=1" is default since PHP 4.3.0.
 
e.g.
 
"http://localhost/symphony/?PHPSESSID=APPARITION666".
 
As Symphonys Session ID is not regenerated it can result in arbitrary
Session ID being 'Fixated' to a user, if that user authenticates using
this attacker supplied session fixated link, the attacker can now access
the affected application from a different Computer/Browser
and have the same level of access to that of the victim. Default Cookie
lifetime for Symphony CMS is up to two weeks.
 
 
 
Reproduction steps:
=====================
 
Edit PHP.INI and change following settings to 'session.use_only_cookies=0'
if applicable, as POC test.
