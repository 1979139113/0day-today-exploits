Product web page: http://www.austin-hughes.com
Affected version: Q213V1 (Firmware: V2395S)
Fixed version: Q216V3 (Firmware: IPD-02-FW-v03)
 
Summary: InfraPower Manager PPS-02-S is a FREE built-in GUI of each
IP dongle ( IPD-02-S only ) to remotely monitor the connected PDUs.
Patented IP Dongle provides IP remote access to the PDUs by a true
network IP address chain. Only 1xIP dongle allows access to max. 16
PDUs in daisy chain - which is a highly efficient cient application
for saving not only the IP remote accessories cost, but also the true
IP addresses required on the PDU management.
 
Desc: InfraPower suffers from multiple stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities
when input passed via several parameters to several scripts is not properly
sanitized before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user&#039;s browser session in context of an affected
site.
 
Tested on: Linux 2.6.28 (armv5tel)
           lighttpd/1.4.30-devel-1321
           PHP/5.3.9
           SQLite/3.7.10
