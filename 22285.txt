Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated access to statistics / information disclosure
Unauthenticated users can access server statistics. These statistics give
details about the webserver status (nginx_status) as well as system level
information (munin system monitoring).

2) Unauthenticated SQL injection
Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary SQL statements via a vulnerability
in the device registration component. The statements will be executed with the
high-privileges of the MySQL user "root". This user has permissions to read and
write files from/to disk.

3) Backdoor accounts
Several undocumented operating system user accounts exist on the appliance.
They can be used to gain access to the appliance via the terminal but also
via SSH.


Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1) Unauthenticated access to statistics / information disclosure
The information can be accessed via the following URLs:
https://<host>/nginx_status
https://<host>/munin/


2) Unauthenticated SQL injection
The following POST request uses this vulnerability to write a file with the
content "TEST" to /tmp/test_outfile:

Detailed proof of concept exploits have been removed for this vulnerability.

To demonstrate impact of the issue, the following 2 POST requests will create
a MySQL trigger that adds the superadmin user "secconsult" (password:
"secconsult") to the user table. (A reboot mysqld/system is required before the
trigger is enabled.)

Detailed proof of concept exploits have been removed for this vulnerability.

Affected script: /wsf/webservice.php


3) Backdoor accounts
The passwd and shadow file show that the following accounts exist. The
password hashes have been removed from this advisory.

epproot:x:1000:1000:epproot,,,:/home/epproot:/bin/bash
epproot:*removed*:15449:0:99999:7:::

endpoint:x:1001:1001::/home/endpoint:/bin/sh
endpoint:*removed*:15449:0:99999:7:::

eppsupport:x:1002:1002::/home/eppsupport:/bin/sh
eppsupport:*removed*:15449:0:99999:7:::

The "epproot" user can elevate privileges to root easily via the sudo command,
while the remaining users can get shell access and gain root privileges via
kernel exploits etc.
