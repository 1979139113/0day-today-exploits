Network Time System Server v2.3.4 
Both x86/x64 versions
 
 
Network Time System provides a solution to system time maintenance problems. This powerful client/server software enables you to set up a
virtually fail-safe synchronized time environment for networks of any size and complexity, from small office networks (LAN) to those
maintained at large enterprises (VPN, VLAN, WAN), from single site networks to those including numerous domains and involving complex
establishing an interconnected time synchronization system for each and every machine and device on the company network.
 
 
Vulnerability Type:
===================
Denial Of Service
 
 
 
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2018-7658
 
 
Security Issue:
================
Network Time System (Server) "NTSServerSvc" service listens on Port 7001, unauthenticated remote attackers can crash the
Server by sending exactly 11 bytes to the target system. Systems which may depend on critical time synchronization 
could then potentially be impacted.
