SoftArtisans SAFileUp 5.0.14 (viewsrc.asp) Script Source Disclosure
===================================================================



SoftArtisans FileUp viewsrc.asp remote script source disclosure exploit 

Advisory Name: SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) viewsrc.asp remote script source disclosure exploit 
Tested and Confirmed Vulerable: SoftArtisans SAFileUp(TM) 5.0.14 (Standard) 
Severity: High Type: Script 
source disclosure From where: Remote 
Discovered by: Inge Henriksen 
Vendor Status: Notified Overview: 

SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) is a popular web server component for transactional uploading of files to a 
web server using a web browser. 

When installing SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) you should avoid installing the samples as viewsrc.asp can 
let remote anonymous users see script source code or configuration settings outside the 
/SAFileUpSamples virtual directory. This is accomplished by modifying the "path" query variable to 
point to files outside the designated directory. A web browser from a remote location is a 
sufficient tool to see the source code or configuration settings in plain text. 

Proof-of Concept: 

The following url would show the configuration settings for www.example.xom: 

http://www.example.xom/SAFileUpSamples/util/viewsrc.asp?path=/SAFileUpSamples/%c0%ae./%c0%ae./web.config 


The %c0%ae is Unicode for the "." character on a english language server, the url is therefore 
http://www.example.xom/SAFileUpSamples/util/viewsrc.asp?path=/SAFileUpSamples/../../web.config, in 
addition the unicode character avoids the security checks inside the code of viewsrc.asp which won&#039;t 
let any ".." pass through. Keep in mind that other unicode&#039;s will also work. Also note that OS&#039;es 
with other language settings will be vulnerable to different unicodes, thus %c0%ae might not work on 
a chinese server but some other unicode&#039;s should work just as well.
