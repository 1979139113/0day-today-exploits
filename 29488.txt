Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Magento Connect web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own script code on the application-side of the affected application module.

The vulnerability is located in the `claim%5Bclaimed_extension_url` value of the `magento-connect/claim/claim/new/` module.
Remote attackers are able to inject own script code on the application-side of the service to compromise user/moderator/admin 
session data. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the affected module.

The security risk of the web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8.
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low 
or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, 
persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules (api).
