Details:
========
1.1
An arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability is detected in AVAs AVAVoIP Communication Application v1.5.12.
An attacker can upload a php file to the website and access this php file to control the entire site.
The vulnerability can only be exploited with privileged application user account. The bug is located 
in the FX rates > upload FX rates application function in the fx_rates_upload.php file.

Vulnerable Section(s):
        [+] FX rates > upload FX rates

Vulnerable File(s):
        [+] fx_rates_upload.php



1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in AVAs AVAVoIP Communication Application v1.5.12.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) 
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account. The persistent 
vulnerabilities are located in multiple different files and also the bound parameters & affected output listings.

1.3
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in AVAs AVAVoIP Communication Application v1.5.12.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator & admin sessions with medium/high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation result in account steal, phishing & 
client-side context request manipulation. 


Vulnerable File(s):
                          [+] agent_accounts_report.php
                          [+] tariff_add.php
                          [+] routeset_set.php


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                          [+] routeset_id
                          [+] tariff_id
                          [+] agent_id


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The local file include vulnerability can be exploited by privileged user accounts without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

The attacker can go to the vulnerable file which is located at FX rates > upload FX rates. The upload function in 
the vulnerable page (fx_rates_upload.php) doesn&#039;t check the extension of the uploaded file. However, it checks the 
format of the file via own flag. Therefore if the attacker uploaded a php file like this

<?
echo "test";
<?
The Attacker will get an error because it is not satisfying the format of how the uploaded file should be, but if the 
attacker uploaded the following file ...

<? //ZIMBABWE,BWP,7.7160
echo "test"; //ZIMBABWE,BWP,7.7160
?> //ZIMBABWE,BWP,7.7160

The file will be successfully uploaded. The attacker bypassed the check of the format of the uploaded file function and 
get a working php file because the data that we added are commented out.


1.2
The persistent script code injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by privileged user accounts with low required user
inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
