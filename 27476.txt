Splunk provides the leading platform for Operational Intelligence. Customers use Splunk to search, monitor, analyze

Vulnerability Type:
==================================
Javascript (JSON) Information Theft
 
 
 
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-5607
 
 
 
Security Issue:
================
Attackers can siphon information from Splunk Enterprise if an authenticated Splunk user visits a malicious webpage.
Some useful data gained is the currently logged in username and if remote user setting is enabled. After, the username
can be use to Phish or Brute Force Splunk Enterprise login. Additional information stolen may aid in furthering attacks.
 
Root cause is the global Window JS variable assignment of config?autoload=1 &#039;$C&#039;.
 
e.g.
 
window.$C = {"BUILD_NUMBER": 207789, "SPLUNKD_PATH"... etc... }
 
To steal information we simply can define a function to be called when the &#039;$C&#039; JS property is "set" on webpage, for example.
Object.defineProperty( Object.prototype, "$C", { set:function(val){...
 
The Object prototype is a Object that every other object inherits from in JavaScript, if we create a setter on the name of our target
in this case "$C", we can get/steal the value of this data, in this case it is very easy as it is assigned to global Window namespace.
 
 
Affected Splunk Enterprise versions:
6.5.x before 6.5.3
6.4.x before 6.4.6
6.3.x before 6.3.10
