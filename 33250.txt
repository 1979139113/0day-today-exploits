Summary:

AppXSvc improperly handles file hard links resulting in a low privileged user
being able to take &#039;Full Control&#039; of an arbitrary file leading to elevation of
privilege.

Description:

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the AppX Deployment Server
(AppXSvc) improperly handles file hard links. While researching CVE-2019-0841
originally reported by Nabeel Ahmed, I have found that AppXSvc sometimes opens
the settings.dat[.LOGx] files of Microsoft Edge for a restore operation that
modifies the security descriptor of the files. Further analyzis revealed that
accessing the settings.dat[.LOGx] files. This can be achieved by locking the
settings.dat[.LOGx] file, resulting in &#039;Access Denied&#039; and &#039;Sharing Violation&#039;
errors when Edge and AppXSvc are trying to access it. Eventually the restore
operation kicks in and if the settings.dat[.LOGx] file has been replaced with
a hard link AppXSvc will overwrite the security descriptor of the target file.
A low privileged user can leverage this vulnerability to take &#039;Full Control&#039;
of an arbitrary file.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Terminate Edge.
2. Create a hard link from settings.dat.LOG2 to C:\Windows\win.ini.
3. Open the hard link for reading and lock the file.
4. Start Edge and wait a few seconds for the restore operation to kick in.
5. Unlock the file and close the file handle.

Expected result:
Full access (GENERIC_ALL) to C:\Windows\win.ini is denied.

Observed result:
C:\Windows\win.ini has had it&#039;s security descriptor rewritten to grant
&#039;Full Control&#039; to the low privileged user.
