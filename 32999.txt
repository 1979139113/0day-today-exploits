Manufacturer: FANUC Robotics America, Inc.
Affected Version(s): V8.23
Tested Version(s): V8.23
Vulnerability Type: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) 
Risk Level: High
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-13585
Author of Advisory: Sebastian Hamann, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

FANUC Robotics Virtual Robot Controller is an application for
programming simulated industry robots.

Due to a stack-based buffer overflow, the remote admin web server
(vrimserve.exe) is vulnerable to denial-of-service and remote code
execution attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

vrimserve.exe offers an HTTP service on TCP port 8090, which can be used
to control virtual robots and view their log files.

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the log viewer
functionality. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the HTTP
server, the application can be crashed causing a denial-of-service
condition.

Remote code execution may also be possible, but was not confirmed
by SySS GmbH. Gaining control over the instruction pointer (EIP) of this
32 bit application by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerability was successful.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept exploit that crashes
vrimserve.exe. It is to note that the exploit gives control over the EIP

curl "http://${target_host}:8090/namedrobots/folder/dir/<1268 bytes>BBBBCCCCCCCCC"

The bytes denoted as B overwrite the EIP register.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The vendor has not yet released a security update.

It is recommended not making the remote admin web server (vrimserve.exe)
available to untrusted networks.
