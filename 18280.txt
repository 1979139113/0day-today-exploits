MobileSpy Android|iPhone|W7P|sOS - Web Vulnerabilities

Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
7.3


Introduction:
=============
Mobile Spy defines the latest in high-tech cell phone surveillance. This revolutionary software allows individuals to easily install 
monitoring software directly onto a compatible smartphone that you own or have the proper consent to monitor. Once the software is 
installed onto the phone to be monitored, it silently logs activity such as SMS messages and call information along with recording 
GPS locations every 30 minutes when a GPS signal is available. There  no need to worry about being near the phone to view the activity 
after installation because activities are uploaded to a private account viewable using ANY web browser, even a Mac or phone web browser. 
Here s a diagram to help you visualize how this process works. This hybrid software gives you the ability to monitor your BlackBerry, iPhone, 
iPad, Android, Windows Mobile or Symbian OS based smartphone. Mobile Spy is the next generation of smartphone spy software. Do you suspect that 
your child or employee is abusing their SMS or vehicle privileges? If yes, then this software is ideal for you. Install this small program 
directly onto your compatible smartphone you want to monitor to begin recording.

Software is also available for Symbian OS, iOS (IPhone), Android(Google), Windows 7 Phone & Blackberry mobiles.

Details:
========
1.1
Multiple server-side input validation vulnerabilities(persistent) are detected in the MobileSpy Surveillance web application. 
A remote attacker can manipulate specific application (paramater) requests or can hijack customer/spy sessions with low user inter action.

Vulnerable Modules: 
			[+] SMS Messages Sent and Received - Listing
			     [-] SMS Logs - View SMS - Text Message Display and Sender

1.2
Multiple client side input validation vulnerabilities (non-persistent) are detected in the MobileSpy Surveillance web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context 
manipulation. Exploitation requires medium or high user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s): 
			[+] Login
			[+] Search Module

1.3
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the MobileSpy Surveillance web application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands 
on the affected application dbms. The vulnerability is located in the pgno= & order by application value request. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise. 

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Parameter (pgno=|0&order=)

ORDER BY SmsDate DESC, SmsTime DESC LIMIT -50, 50 has error!

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent application vulnerabilities are estimated as high.

1.2
The security risk of the non persistent cross site vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).

1.3
The security risk of the remote sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
