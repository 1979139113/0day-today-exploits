 
OfficeImport is located at /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/OfficeImport.framework/Versions/A/OfficeImport.
 
I attached a PoC that will just print out "location.href". You can test it by "Right click -> Quick Look" on macOS or just opening the PoC file on iOS.
 
Here's the document.xml file of the PoC file where I injected JavaScript code.
 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 
document.write(location.href);
