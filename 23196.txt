Mangallam CMS - SQL Injection Web Vulnerability

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Mangallam Content Management System 2015-Q1.
The sql vulnerability allows an attacker to inject sql commands to compromise the application & database management system.
 
The sql injection vulnerability is located in the `newsid` value of the vulnerable `news_view.php` application file. Remote attackers
are able to inject own sql commands by  manipulation of the vulnerable newsid value in the `news_view.php` file. A successful attack
requires to manipulate a GET method request with vulnerable `newsid` value to inject own sql commands. The injection is a classic
order by sql injection that allows to compromise the web-application and connected database management system. The request method to
inject own sql commands is GET and the vulnerability is located on the application-side of the service.
 
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.9.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability result in web-application and database management system compromise.
 
Request Method(s):
                [+] GET
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] News
 
Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] news_view.php
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] newsid
 
 
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote sql injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account or user interaction.

Reference(s):
http://localhost:8080/news_view.php
 
 
Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Restrict and filter the newsid value and disallow input of special chars. Prevent disaplaying of php errors by usage of the (0)error (php) function.
 
 
 
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql injection web vulnerability in the content management system is estimated as critical.
