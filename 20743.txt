Overview
 
Linksys is a brand of home and small office networking products and a
company founded in 1988, which was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2003. In
2013, as part of its push away from the consumer market, Cisco sold their
home networking division and Linksys to Belkin. Former Linksys products are
now branded as Linksys by Cisco.
 
 
 
broadband and wireless routers, consumer and small business grade Ethernet
switching, VoIP equipment, wireless internet video camera, AV products,
network storage systems, and other products.
 
 
 
Linksys products were widely available in North America off-the-shelf from
both consumer electronics stores (CompUSA and Best Buy), internet
retailers, and big-box retail stores (WalMart). Linksys&#039; significant
competition as an independent networking firm were D-Link and NetGear, the
latter for a time being a brand of Cisco competitor Nortel.
