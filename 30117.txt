The vulnerability exists in plain text & hard coded cookie. Using any
cookie manager extension, an attacker can bypass login page by setting
the following Master Cookie.

Cookie: Name=0admin

Then access the homepage which will no longer require
authentication.http://192.168.10.1/

Due to improper session implementation, there is another way to bypass
login. The response header of homepage without authentication looks
like this.
