V. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The "webdav" folder uses HTTP authentication which can be bypassed using the backdoor account. This allows to get access to the website as the administrator and then create more administrator users, change passwords of any username, delete usernames, create groups, download the list of all the users (with email addresses, phone numbers, full names ...). It is also possible to upload or overwrite any file in the WebDAV server. The "webdav" folder is located by default in the root of the website. This is caused by a vulnerable version of the "DevTools" plugin, installed by default.
