2. *Vulnerability Information*
 
Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0980
 
 
3. *Vulnerability Description*
 
Publish-It [1] is prone to a (client side) security vulnerability when
processing .PUI files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine, by enticing
the user of Publish-It to open a specially crafted .PUI file.
  
 
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
 
 . Publish-It v3.6d for Win XP.
 . Publish-It v3.6d for Win 7.
 . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.
 
  
5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
 
There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted .PUI
files. Contact vendor for further information.
  
  
6. *Credits*
 
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Daniel Kazimirow
from Core Exploit Writers Team.
 
 
7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
 
Below is shown the result of opening the Proof of concept file [2] on
Windows XP SP3 (EN).

The arbitrary value 0x04040404 is stored in the EIP register where our
shellcode starts (just a software breakpoint 0xCC):
