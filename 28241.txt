Business recommendation:
------------------------
The patch should be installed immediately. Furthermore, SEC Consult recommends
to perform a thorough security review of this software.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The phpBB forum software is vulnerable to the server side request forgery
(SSRF) attack. An attacker is able to perform port scanning, requesting
internal content and potentially attacking such internal services via the
web application&#039;s "Remote Avatar" function.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a registered account
as low as a normal account. If the web application enables remote avatar, this
feature could be abused by an attacker to perform port scanning. Below is the
example on how the SSRF issue can be exploited.

URL       : http://$DOMAIN/ucp.php?i=ucp_profile&mode=avatar
METHOD    : POST
PARAMETER  : avatar_remote_url
PAYLOAD   : http://$DOMAIN:$PORT/x.jpg


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
phpBB version 3.2.0 has been tested. This version was the latest
at the time the security vulnerability was discovered.
