Apache XML Graphics FOP information disclosure vulnerability

Severity:
Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
FOP 1.0 - 2.1

Description:
Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can
be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG
files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context
in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root
a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive
files--would be possible.

XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server
via denial of service as the references within a xml document
can trivially trigger an amplification attack.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to FOP 2.2+

This issue was independently reported by Pierre Ernst at Salesforce.
