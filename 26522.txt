CVE-2016-7866
APSB16-38
 
 
 
Vulnerability Details:
=====================
Adobe Animate suffers from a Buffer Overflow when creating .FLA files with
ActionScript Classes that use overly long Class names.
This causes memory corruption leading to possible arbitrary code execution
upon opening a maliciously created .Fla Flash file.
 
 
Reproduction / POC:
 
 
1) Create FLA with overly long Class name in FLA Class publish properties
input field.
2) Save and close
3) Reopen FLA, click edit to open the .as script file
4) "ctrl + s" to save then boom.... access violation
 
 
Distributed:
Create new ".as" ActionScript 3 (AS3) file and give it very long class name
in input field then hit "Ctrl+s" to save..
you will crash IDE, next way described is ONE way how attackers can
distribute malicious .FLA
 
Abusing JSFL, The Flash JavaScript application programming interface
(JavaScript API or JSAPI).
 
1) Create following .JSFL file
 
fl.getDocumentDOM().save();
fl.getDocumentDOM().testMovie();
 
2)  Create a MovieClip stored in FLA library with a very long class name
that extends MovieClip and export
   it for ActionScript etc...
 
 
3) Drag the MovieClip to the stage
 
 
4) Bundle FLA/JSFL file, make avail for download as example on how to use
JSFL to call save() / publish() functions.
 
 
User opens .FLA, runs harmless looking JSFL code then BOOM!
