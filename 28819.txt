Details:
========
The function in charge of checking whether the user is already logged in 
init.php in Interspire Email Marketer (IEM) prior to 6.1.6 allows 
remote attackers to bypass authentication and obtain administrative 
access by using the IEM_CookieLogin cookie with a specially crafted 
value.
On top of that, if the customer doesn&#039;t have an annuel maintenance plan, 
the application says that it&#039;s on the last available version and there is no update.

The vulnerabilities were found during an incident response on a compromise 
instance of the application.
