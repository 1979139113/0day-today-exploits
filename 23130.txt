Affected Product(s):
====================
Perception System
Product: File Pro Mini - iOS Mobile Web Application (Evereader Wifi-Sharing) 5.3

Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Perception System - File Pro Mini v5.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific 
path commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The vulnerability is located in the filename value of the `Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing - Index` module. Local attackers are able to manipulate the 
wifi web interface by usage of the vulnerable upload function.  The service does not encode or parse the context of uploaded files.

Local attacker are able to manipulate the input of the files to exploit the issue by a POST method request to the wifi web-application interface. 
The execution of unauthorized local file or path request occurs in the index file dir listing module of the `Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing` application.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side of the online-service.

The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.6. 
Exploitation of the file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. Successful exploitation 
of the local file include web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.

Vulnerable Method(s):
        [+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] filename

Affected Module(s):
        [+] Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing - Index


1.2
A local command/path injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Perception System - File Pro Mini v5.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.

The vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `albumname` value of the `Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing - Index` module. Local attackers are able to inject own 
malicious system specific commands or path value requests to the vulnerable `albumname` value. The execution of the local command inject occurs in the 
`Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing - Index` module of file dir index. The attacker is able to manipulate the albumnames in the index module of the application by 
can be manipulated by sync to compromise the iOS mobile application.

The attack vector is on the application-side and the injection requires physical device access and a local low privileged user account. Local attackers are 
also able to exploit the albumname validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute different local malicious attack requests.

The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 5.9.
Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a low privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to 
compromise the mobile iOS application or the connected device components.

Request Method(s):
        [+] [GET] (Execution)

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] Albums

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] albumname

Affected Module(s):
        [+] Evereader Wi-Fi Sharing - Index

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.1
The local file include web vulnerability can be patched by a secure aprse and encode of the vulnerable filename value in the upload module POST method request.

1.2
To fix the second vulnerability encode and parse the albumname value on sync (PUT) request.
Filter the albumname values and restrict the input to disallow special chars and script code tags.
