# Title: AIC Audio Player 1.4.1.587 Local Crash PoC
# Author: b0telh0
# Link: http://www.aic-media.com/Download/Setup_AICAudioPlayer.exe
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3
 
# I couldn&#039;t even debug it. There&#039;s some anti-debugging protection...
# Tried !hidedebug from immunity debugger too...
# So, i&#039;m not sure if we have more than just a crash!
# If someone have any advice, it would be cool learning about
anti-debugging techniques.
