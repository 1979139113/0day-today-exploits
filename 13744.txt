Background:
===========

our E-Class SRA appliances. Aventail&#039;s best-of-breed SSL VPNs deliver
secure remote access to the most resources from the most end point
locations. Aventail was named in the Visionaries Quadrant in the SSL
VPN Magic Quadrant Report from Gartner, considered to be the leading

Description:
============
 
Remote exploitation of a format string overflow vulnerability in the
End-Point Interrogator/Installer ActiveX Control could allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the targeted
user.
 
The affected function is "AuthCredential". The functions
"ConfigurationString" seems to be also vulnerable, but the format
string has to be base64 decoded.
