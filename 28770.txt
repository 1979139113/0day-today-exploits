3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis, ThunderScan discovered Local File
Inclusion vulnerability in WP Ad Widget plugin. By requesting a
specially crafted URL, the attacker can cause remote server to execute
a php file of his choosing. Although the user requesting the URL has
to be logged into the WordPress administrative console, the attacker
can cause the administrator to request such a URL by using various
social engineering/phishing approaches. Specified file will be
executed. If the php installation on server has "allow_url_include=1"
configuration option set, this attack can be expanded to execute a php
file from any remote URL. If the php version is less than 5.3.4, the
".php" that gets appended to the end of the file name attacker chose
can be omitted by adding a null character ("%00") to the requested
URL, and enable the attacker to execute any file, regardless of the
extension.
