Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a remote sql injection web vulnerability in the official CIS Manager Content Management System.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official CIS Content Management System 2015-Q4.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own sql commands to compromise the web-applicaation or connected dbms.

The vulnerability is located in the `TroncoID` value of the `default.php` file. Remote attackers are able to execute own sql commands 
by manipulation of the GET method request with the vulnerable TroncoID parameter. The request method to inject the sql command is GET 
and the issue is located on the application-side of the `./site/` online-service path. The sql vulnerability allows remote attackers to 
compromise the database management system that is connected to the web-application. The issue is a classic order-by sql injection issue.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.3.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
            [+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] ./site/

Vulnerable File(s):
            [+] default.asp

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] TroncoID


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The sql-injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
