Vulnerability Type:
===================
Remote Internal Command Access



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2018-7756



Security Issue:
================
The installer for DEWESoft X3 SP1 (64-bit) devices, specifically the "RunExeFile.exe" component does not require authentication
for sessions on TCP port 1999, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access internal commands, as demonstrated by a
RUN command that can launch an .EXE file located at an arbitrary directory location, download an .EXE from an external URL, or Run 
a "SETFIREWALL Off" command. 

The RunExeFile.exe "Launcher" is located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\DEWESoft Shared\" after installing using the full-install.

Internal commands used by "RunExeFile.exe" for which I could not find any documentation.

RUN <ANY EXE>
RUNEX <ANY EXE>
GETFIREWALL
SETFIREWALL Off
KILL <PROCESS>
USERNAME
SHUTDOWN
SENDKEYS
