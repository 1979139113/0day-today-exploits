Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Zikula Application Framework, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Zikula Application Framework: CVE-2013-6168

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "returnpage" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display "ImmuniWeb" word:

http://[host]/index.php?module=users&type=user&func=login&returnpage=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27ImmuniWeb%27%29;%3C/script%3E
