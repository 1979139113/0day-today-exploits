
Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the Flogr v2.5.6 & v2.3 photo gallery CMS.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerabilities are located in the recent.php & index.php 
with the bound vulnerable tag parameter. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing & client-side 
content request manipulation.
