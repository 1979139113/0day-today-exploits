Sourcetree for macOS - Git submodules vulnerability (CVE-2018-11235)

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:

The embedded version of Git used in Sourcetree for macOS was vulnerable to
CVE-2018-11235. An attacker can exploit this issue if they can commit to a Git
repository linked in Sourcetree for macOS or that has been recursively cloned or
if a user interacts with a submodule. This allows them to execute arbitrary code
on systems running a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for macOS.
Versions of Sourcetree for macOS starting with version 1.02b before version
2.7.4 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked at:
