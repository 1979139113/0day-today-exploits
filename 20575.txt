not succeed in finding a way to get a shell on the device. The box is
Hi3515 based, I found an exploit for another similar box (Ray Sharp) but it
did not work. The Rosewill firmware seems to use an executable that listens
on two ports rather one when communicating with the Windows-based control
software. Port 8000 is now the command port rather 9000, 9000 is used for
video only. After playing with the included Windows application I
eventually did a strings on the &#039;hi_dvr&#039; exectuable that is the user space
program that controls the interface to thing. I found this gem:
 
/mnt/ntpdate -q %s > /tmp/tmpfs/ntptmp
 
So I used the windows software to set the NTP host to
 
a;/usr/bin/nc -l -p 5555 -e /bin/sh&
 
Next I power cycled the box and a root shell was waiting a minute later on
the port. By default it runs this command on startup and once a day. So if
the exploit is remote-only there will be a delay period. Of course, the
&#039;authentication&#039; done on the command port is just a charade to the user as
from my capture session to pull this exploit off.
 
The box is not very interesting once you are in. It&#039;s a linux 2.6.24 kernel
with RT patches and busy box user space. I don&#039;t have access to the SDK for
Hi3515 (different than Hi3511). The kernel modules for Video Input, Video
Output, Audio Output, H264 encoding etc are there but in binary only (non
stripped) form.
 
To set the NTP host to the request to replay to port 8000 tcp is:

The second request to the same port causes the device to save its flash
memory:

The Rosewill RSVA12001 is the same unit with different supplied cameras and
should have the same vulnerability.
