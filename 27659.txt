1. Description
 
DCCService.exe is running on autostart as System.

This service has auto update functionality.

Basically it periodically checks https://otbs.azurewebsites.net looking for new config file.

Under normal conditions we cannot spoof this connection because itâ€™s SSL.

But here WebUtils.sendWebRequest() is executed using Impersonator.RunImpersonated().

RunImpersonated() executes given function in the context of currently logged in user.

In Windows system we can add any certificate to Local user root store.

Then this certificate is considered as trusted so we can perform MITM attack.

It can be done using simple proxy server because by default .NET HttpWebRequest() uses IE proxy settings (which can by set by any user without administrator priveleges).
