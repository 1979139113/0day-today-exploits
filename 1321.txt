You might already have heard of logahead - the ajaxified blogging engine using PHP4 and mySQL database by James from the UK.
The UNU edition is based on the logahead beta 1.0 code published under GNU/GPL license. While the original version sticks to 
the basic functions of a blog (mainly publishing posts and receiving comments), the UNU edition is more enchanted and offers 
a number of additional features.


..::[ Bug ]::..

a remote attaker is able to upload also a file php, and to perform arbitrary commands
inside the server victim.
