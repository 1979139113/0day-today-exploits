Arbitrary File Upload



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Vulnerability Details:
=====================

The package comes with an "upload_example.php" file to test the package, when uploading a "restricted" PHP file
user will get message like "Unauthorized file transmission".

Line: 488 of "Upload.php"
var $_extensionsCheck = array('php', 'phtm', 'phtml', 'php3', 'inc');

If user does not go thru the "Upload.php" code line by line. They will find option to set case sensitive check.
e.g. Line: 503 "$_extensionsCaseSensitive"=true

Line: 874

* @param bool $case_sensitive whether extension check is case sensitive.

* When it is case insensitive, the extension

* is lowercased before compared to the array

* of valid extensions.



However, some developers are unaware that "Apache" can process file with extension like PHP.1, PHP.; etc.
if the last extension is not specified in the list of mime-types known to the web server.

Therefore, attackers can easily bypass the security check by appending ".1" to end of the file,
which can result in arbitrary command execution on the affected server.

e.g.

"ext_bypass.php.1" contents:

<?php

echo passthru('cat /etc/passwd');

?>
