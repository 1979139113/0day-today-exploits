Description
================
Admin-only local file inclusion and arbitrary code execution in Subscribe to Comments 2.1.2

Vulnerability
================
Administrators can perform Local File include attacks, which is a privilege escalation on systems where the administrator doesn’t have control over the server. If administrators can upload PHP files (or any file which can contain “<?php …”), they can also perform arbitrary code execution by the same method.
