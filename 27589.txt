User visits attacker.com
Attacker forces a lookup to asdad839qd.attacker.com via <img src> or whatever.
Now attacker can guess your resolver, etc.
Attacker create an <iframe> to nintendo.com
Attacker spoofs dns responses saying nintendo.com is an address he controls.
Attacker can now send javascript and read document.cookie, etc.
That's just an example, I don't know if you also download any software or anything else without authentication.

If you do, then those can obviously be spoofed and the impact is worse.

Reproduce:

Run tcpdump on some egress point on your network.
Open the browser and lookup blahblahtest1.com, blahblahtest2.com, etc.
Notice the requests are easy to guess.

I had to send this via HackerOne, as Nintendo are not easy to contact.
