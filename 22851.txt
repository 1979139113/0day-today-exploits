
header injection

in anchor/models/comment.php

$headers  = &#039;MIME-Version: 1.0&#039; . "\r\n";
$headers .= &#039;Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8&#039; . "\r\n";
$headers .= &#039;From: notifications@&#039; . $_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_HOST&#039;] . "\r\n";

49: mail($to, __(&#039;comments.notify_subject&#039;), $message, $headers);

so it  is possible to inject arbitary "From" headers or any header
using CRLF. simply by tampering and changing the host to bad.com or
bad.com\r\nNew-Header:Hacked!
