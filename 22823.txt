Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in HelpDEZk, which can be exploited to compromise vulnerable web site.


1) Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in HelpDEZk: CVE-2014-8337

The vulnerability exists due to absence of validation of file extensions when uploading files in "/includes/classes/uploadify-v2.1.4/uploadify.php" script. A remote attacker can upload files with arbitrary extension into directory within application's web root and execute them with privileges of the web server. 

Additionally, access to the upload script is not restricted to anonymous users. A remote unauthenticated attacker can access the vulnerable script and successfully upload malicious files on the server. 

Below we provide an example of form that can be used to upload files on the vulnerable website:


<form action="http://[host]/includes/classes/uploadify-v2.1.4/uploadify.php?folder=" method="post" name="main" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="Filedata">
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Remove "uploadify" files from "/includes/classes/" directory.
