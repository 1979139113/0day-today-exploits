My 7 line python fuzzer found several file format bugs in 3 hours. Quite alarming.

No deep analysis was done, I leave that to the community.

These are some of the results:

 

file789-1.doc  - Unspecified Overflow in word 2007 - Crash in wwlib.dll . Code execution is not trivial.

file798-1.doc . Word 2007 CPU exhaustion DOS - CPU shoots up to 100 %.

file613-1.doc -  Word 2007 CPU exhaustion DOS + ding - CPU shoots up to 100 %, and windows goes .ding!.
