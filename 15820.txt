# Bug Found: April 9th 2011
# Found by: loneferret (as far as I know anyway)
# Software Download Link:
http://phpkode.com/download/p/2381_nooms_1.1.1.tar.bz2
# Nods to exploit-db Team
 
 
# Well, I didn&#039;t have much to do this morning so figured I&#039;d try to see how
# fast it would take
# me to find one of these. It&#039;s nothing to write home about. I mean...come
# on! Who would use
# a CMS named NooMS? This thing uses a MySQL database as well, wouldn&#039;t be
# surprised if
# there are other things to be found.
# But I need to get some chores done before the wife starts.
 
#
# Enjoy,
# loneferret
#
# p.s:
# I wanted to contact the creator, but he&#039;s page (using NooMS) is
# blank... nothing there so.. sorry.
