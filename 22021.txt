 
Zoo is prone to a local buffer-overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to do proper bounds checking on user-supplied data before using it in a finite-sized buffer.
 
An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim user running the affected application to potentially gain elevated privileges.
