A call to the String.prototype.localeCompare method can be inlineed when it only takes one argument. There are two versions of String.prototype.localeCompare, one [1] is written in JavaScript and the other [2] is written in C++ which just calls the JavaScript version when Intl enabled without updating ImplicitCallFlags. Since JavaScript code could be executed without touching ImplicitCallFlags, this could be exploited in a similar way to that I used for <a href="/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1565" title="Microsoft Edge: Chakra: JIT: ImplicitCallFlags check bypass with Intl" class="closed_ref" rel="nofollow"> issue 1565 </a>.

The only usable code I could find in the JavaScript localeCompare was:
            const thatStr = String(that);

I could override the toString method of "that" which is the first parameter to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. But there was a problem that the toString method was also called in the C++ localeCompare prior to executing the JavaScript localeCompare which updated ImplicitCallFlags. Actually calling a JavaScript function can clear the flag during the initialization process [3] if profiling is enabled, but it was not for Intl.js. So I needed to find another way to exploit this.

Here&#039;s the JavaScript localeCompare.

let localeCompareStateCache;
platform.registerBuiltInFunction(tagPublicFunction("String.prototype.localeCompare", function (that, locales = undefined, options = undefined) {
    if (this === undefined || this === null) {
        platform.raiseThis_NullOrUndefined("String.prototype.localeCompare");
    }

    const thisStr = String(this);
    const thatStr = String(that);

    // Performance optimization to cache the state object and UCollator when the default arguments are provided
    // TODO(jahorto): investigate caching when locales and/or options are provided
    let stateObject;
    if (locales === undefined && options === undefined) {
        if (localeCompareStateCache === undefined) {
            localeCompareStateCache = _.create();
            InitializeCollator(localeCompareStateCache, undefined, undefined);
        }

        stateObject = localeCompareStateCache;
    } else {
        stateObject = _.create();
        InitializeCollator(stateObject, locales, options);
    }

    return platform.localeCompare(thisStr, thatStr, stateObject, /* forStringPrototypeLocaleCompare */ true);
}), IntlBuiltInFunctionID.StringLocaleCompare);

My idea was to optimize the method partially, so that when it hits an unprofiled instruction, the flag gets cleared during the bailout process [4].
