* System affected  : Audacity [1].
* Software Version : 2.1.2 (other versions may also be affected).
* Impact           : A user may be infected by opening an audio file in 
                     Audacity, from an untrusted location i.e. usb flash drive, 
                     network file share.

=====[ 2. Detailed description ]================================================

Audacity version 2.1.2 is vulnerable to DLL Hijack, it tries to load 
avformat-55.dll without supplying the absolute path, thus relying upon the 
exploitable DLL Hijack vulnerability, even if the SafeDllSerchMode flag is 
enabled.

=====[ 3. Further attack scenarios ]============================================

The attacker can place a malicious dll named avformat-55.dll in the same folder 
of an Audacity project file. Upon opening the project file Audacity will load
and execute the malicious code within its proccess context. The attack may be 
carried out remotely by inducing the victim to open the project file from an 
external storage device or a network file share.
