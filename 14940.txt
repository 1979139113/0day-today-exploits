========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to execute a SQL commands
on the affected application dbms. The sql injection vulnerability is located in dynamiccontenttags file with
the bound vulnerable id parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application
compromise. Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged user account.
 
Vulnerable File(s):
            [+] index.php
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] ID
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] dynamiccontenttags
 
 
1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent
vulnerabilities are located in the user account, user groups, contacts, email campaigns or recent activity module with the bound
vulnerable fullname, groupname, email, content block name and activitylog parameters. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability
can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter
action & privileged web application user account.
 
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] Users&Groups ->  Create a user account
            [+] Users&Groups ->  Create a user group
            [+] Contacts -> Add contact
            [+] Email Campaigns -> Dynamic Content Tags -> Create a Dynamic Content Tag
            [+] Recent Activity
 
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] Full Name
            [+] Group Name
            [+] Email Address
            [+] Content Block name
            [+] All recent activities get executed in the recent activity box
 
 
1.3
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the Interspire Email Marketer v6.0.1, Email Marketing Software.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerability is located in the dynamiccontenttags module with the
bound vulnerable action parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in account steal, client site phishing
or client-side content request manipulation.
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] dynamiccontenttags
 
Vulnerable File(s):
            [+] admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] Action
 
 
Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
PoC:
http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&
Action=Edit&id=-1%27+UNION+Select+1,2,3,4--%20-
 
http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&
Action=Edit&id=-1%27+UNION+Select+1,version%28%29,3,4--%20-
 
 
1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user inter action
& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
 
1.2.1
The attacker can create a user with injecting a malicious code i.e.,
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the field Full name.
When the admin views the users the code gets executed. The attacker also can change his full name in the settings
and whenever the admin checks the user list, the code gets executed
 
URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Users&Action=Add
 
 
1.2.2
The attacker can Create a User group and inject a malicious code in the Group name. Whenever the victim lists the user groups,
the code gets executed in the victim browser.
 
URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=UsersGroups&Action=createGroup
 
1.2.3
The attacker can inject a malicious code in the server side by adding a contact. The attacker goes to Contacts -> add contact
and then try to inject a malicious code in the email field. An error message will pop up that the email is invalid. To bypass,
this message, the attacker creates a normal user with any email i.e., test@test.com. After creating the user, the attacker edit
the user and change the email to the malicious code. The error message will not show up and the code will get executed for any
user who will list the contacts.

URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Subscribers&Action=Add
 
 
1.2.4
The attacker can inject a malicious code in the server side by creating a content block from Dynamic content tags section.
The field "block name" is vulnerable. Whenver the victim views the blocks the code gets Executed.
 
URL: http://emailmarketer.127.0.0.1:337/admin/index.php?Page=Addons&Addon=dynamiccontenttags&Action=edit
 
1.2.5
Finally, Any of the activities gets logged in the recent activity module that gets showed in every screen in the web app.
again in the recent activity module.
