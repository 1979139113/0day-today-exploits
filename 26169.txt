Vulnerability
==============

An SQL Injection vulnerability exists that allows unsanitized commands to be passed into the MYSQL database.

The vulnerability resides inside the index.php and the config.php file:



index.php:
===========

############ AUTH SYSTEM ############
A
IF (isset($_POST['form']) && isset($_POST['username']) && isset($_POST['password']))
A A A {
A A A IF (AuthUser($_REQUEST['username'], $_REQUEST['password']))




unsanitized requests are handled by the function AuthUser which is located inside config.php:


config.php:
===========

Function AuthUser($user, $pass)
A A A {
A A A $query = "A A A SELECT tickets_users_password
A A A A A A A A A FROM tickets_users
A A A A A A A A A WHERE tickets_users_username = '$user'
A A A A A A A A A AND tickets_users_status != '0'";
A
A A A $result = @mysql_query($query);



The variable $user is passed to the MYSQL query completely unchecked and unsanitized and it is possible for command injection to take place here.
