Vulnerability Type:
===================
Privilege Escalation (Unquoted Service Path)



Vulnerability Details:
=====================

"jhi_service.exe" installs with an unquoted service path running with
SYSTEM privileges. If a local malicious user places
thier own executable named "Program.exe" in the path of the service and it
is restarted or on system reboot, this
can allow the user arbitrary code execution to the level of the account
that starts the service (SYSTEM).
