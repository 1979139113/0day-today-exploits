Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
An independent vulnerability laboratory researcher discovered a cross


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the client-side.

The cross site scripting vulnerabilities are located in the `s`
parameter. The request method to inject the malicious script code is GET
and
the attack vector of the vulnerability is non-persistent on client-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external
redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of
affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] s


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The non-persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without user account with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.
