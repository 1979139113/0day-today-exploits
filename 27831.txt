The stored cross site vulnerability is located in the `s` parameter of the `page` module GET method request. Remote attackers are able to 
inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the online service web-application to compromise user session information or 
to permanently manipulate data.

The security risk of the cross site web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.2.
Exploitation of the cross site scripting web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and low user interaction. 
Successful exploitation results in session hijacking, persistent phishings attacks, persistent external redirect and malware loads or persistent 
manipulation of affected and connected module context.
