Attacker can upload files with uploader form

uploaded files go to /joomlaPath/media/uploads

this form builder rename uploaded file with simple combinition between date and time

for example if you upload file it will renamed to >> 2012-09-28-20-05-Unknown-file.txt

[2012-09-28] its current date and [20-05] is time of uploading file (Hour/Minute) And [Unknown] never change,after them your file name

by simple brute force you can find upload time which is hard part of guessing your exact uploaded file
