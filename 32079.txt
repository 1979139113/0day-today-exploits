1. Description:
This plugin keeps a record of a users IP & User-Agent history. The User-Agent isn&#039;t sanitized to user input allowing for an XSS via ACP.
 

2. Proof of Concept:

- Change your User-Agent to a payload   <script>alert(&#039;XSS&#039;)</script>
- Log into an account

When admin visits the IP/User-Agent history page the payload will execute
http://localhost/[path]/admin/index.php?module=tools-ip_history_logs



3. Solution:
Update to 1.0.3
