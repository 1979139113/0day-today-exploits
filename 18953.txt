
Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
org.apache.sling.servlets.post bundle up to 2.1.0

Description:
The @CopyFrom operation of the Sling POST servlet allows for copying a
parent node to one of its descendant nodes, creating an infinite loop
that ultimately results in denial of service, once memory and/or
storage resources are exhausted.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to version 2.1.2 of the
org.apache.sling.servlets.post bundle [1], or apply the Sling patch of
revision 1352865 [2].

Example:
curl -u admin:pwd -d "" "http://localhost:8888/content/foo/?./%40CopyFrom=../"
