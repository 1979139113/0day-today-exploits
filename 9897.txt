6. *Technical Description*
 
A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the dispatch.php script, more
specifically in the $user_id variable. The vulnerability can be triggered by
logging into Achievo and browsing to:
 
/dispatch.php?atknodetype=reports.weekreport&atkaction=report&nameswitch=name&userid=%27&functionlevelswitch=all&startdate[day]=6&startdate[month]=7&startdate[year]=2009&enddate[day]=17&enddate[month]=7&enddate[year]=2009&showstatus=all&outputType=0&atkorderby=period
 
Which will generate a syntax error in the database. The following is
the corresponding piece of code:
 
classweekreport.inc:128-134
function get_employee($user_id)
{
    $db = &atkGetDb();
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM person WHERE status='active' AND id='$user_id'";
    $record = $db->getrows($sql);
    return $record[0];
}
