• Vulnerabilities Description:

1) Input passed via the “authentication_method_ser” and “authentication_info_ser” POST parameters to index.php (when “module” is set to “users”, “func” is set to “register”, “csrftoken” is set to a valid value, and “registration_info” is set to an arbitrary value) is not properly sanitised before being used in a call to the “unserialize()” function. This can be exploited to e.g. delete arbitrary files or inject and execute arbitrary PHP code via specially crafted serialized objects.

2) Input passed via the “zikulaMobileTheme” cookie parameter to index.php is not properly sanitised before being used in a call to the “unserialize()” function in the /lib/util/SecurityUtil.php script. This can be exploited to e.g. delete arbitrary files or inject and execute arbitrary PHP code via specially crafted serialized objects sent in a “Cookie” header.
