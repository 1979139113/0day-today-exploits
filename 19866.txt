are placed at hundreds or millions of web sites. Since my 2008's article XSS
vulnerabilities in 215000 flash files
(http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2008-November/004655.html)
till last advisories about vulnerabilities in JW Player and other
flash-files, which are hosted at millions of sites. For example, any
about vulnerability at one hosting platform which has potentially up to
million of web sites.

Here is Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in libsyn platform (Liberated
Syndication). There are a lot of vulnerable web sites with this XSS on it
(including security sites).

According to Google (site:libsyn.com -site:www.libsyn.com):

At 27.09.2012 there were results: 1890000
At 01.12.2012 there were results: 2080000

It's about pages of all subdomains. But we can take some average number of
pages per site and find the number of sites - approximately it'll be from
100000 till 1 million web sites. The developers haven't fixed vulnerability
for more then two months, even I've informed them multiple times.
