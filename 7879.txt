Enomaly ECP / Enomalism < 2.2.1 Multiple Local Vulnerabilities
==============================================================



Enomaly ECP/Enomalism: Multiple vulnerabilities in enomalism2.sh (redux)

Synopsis

All versions of Enomaly ECP/Enomalism[1] before 2.2.1 have multiple issues
relating to the use of temporary files in an insecure manner.

Fixes for CVE-2008-4990[2] and CVE-2009-0390[3] in 2.1.1 and 2.2 were found
to be ineffective.

Background

Enomaly ECP (formerly Enomalism) is management software for virtual machines.

Description

Sam Johnston[4] of Australian Online Solutions[5] reported multiple
vulnerabilities in enomalism2.sh:
 - Race condition on $PIDFILE renders 2.1.1 fixes ineffective
 - Incomplete fixes in 2.1.1/2.2 fail to address stop/restart functions
 - Root ownership check (ls -l $PIDFILE |grep root) is trivially bypassed by:
   - changing the symlink&#039;s group to one containing the word &#039;root&#039; or
   - creating a symlink to any filename containing the word &#039;root&#039;
 - Process check (ps -p $PID |grep enomalism2d) is also trivially bypassed.

Impact

A local attacker could perform a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files
on the system with root privileges, inject arguments to the &#039;kill&#039; command
to terminate or send arbitrary signals to any process(es) as root or launch

Exploits

a. while true; do ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/enomalism2.pid; done
b. echo "-9 1" > /tmp/enomalism2.pid
c. i. ln -s /tmp/root /tmp/enomalism2.pid
  ii. chgrp beetroot /tmp/enomalism2.pid

Workaround

Change PIDFILE from /tmp/enomalism2.pid to /var/run/enomalism2.pid

Resolution

All Enomaly ECP and Enomalism users should upgrade to version 2.2.1[6] which
includes researcher fix.
