Description:
CommonSense CMS is a Content Management System that is designed for
content-rich websites created for displaying
content
collections and auto-update network, it is a
powerful platform for instantly creating profitable and successful
websites.

Affected file:
search.php

There&#039;re no filters to special chars like <, >, /, etc. Then an attacker
can
execute html code. Chars
like &#039; and " are replaced by a \ but that&#039;s not a problem to a good
attacker, lol...

foreach(explode(" ", $SEARCH) as $t)
{
$t = ereg_replace("[&#039;`]", "", $t);
$t = ereg_replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9_]", " ", $t);
if(strlen($t) > 3)
$queries[] = $t;
}

Example:
http://www.site.com/search.php?q=[XSS]&t=1<http://www.site.com/search.php?q
=%5BXSS%5D&t=1>

Google search -> "Powered by CommonSense CMS script"
