PHPMemcachedAdmin stores data in the server&#039;s filesystem. 
Part of the serialized data and the last part of the concatenated filename may be specified by the user, which can lead to remote code execution e.g. if a php script is created and placed within the webserver&#039;s document root.

All versions prior and including the current version 1.2.2 are affected as far as we know.
