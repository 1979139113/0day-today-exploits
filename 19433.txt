Summary
=======

MF Gig Calendar 0.9.2 is subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The value of a generic parameter was not sufficiently sanitised before being written to the calendar page. An attacker could distribute a malicious URL that would trigger this vulnerability and potentially steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious URL or download malware onto their machine.

Affected Products
======== ========

MF Gig Calendar 0.9.2. Other versions may be affected.


Details
=======

A generic parameter on the calendar page was found to be subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. It was possible to inject arbitrary Javascript into the URL as an additional parameter (following an &#039;&&#039;). This code is then passed into an anchor href parameter without sanitisation, and executed by the browser.

Injecting the following Javascript code into a generic parameter on the calendar page will trigger the vulnerability, causing the page to return a Javascript alert box.

"><script>alert(&#039;xsstest&#039;)</script>

Impact
======

An attacker might entice users to follow a malicious URL, causing Javascript code to execute in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious URL or downloading malware onto their machine.

========

At the time of writing, no patch has been released by the vendor.
