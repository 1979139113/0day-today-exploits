
## Installer - capturing rolback scripts - patch bypass #2

There is still a race condition in the installer.

So there is a really small timing window to win a race, where if we set a junction after the check but before it writes the DACL we can still get our original PoC to work.

Again, it's a really small timing window, and while it appears to reliably reproduce on my setup.. I don't know if it will for yours. I've attached a procmon.exe log.

How to reproduce:

1. Run polarbear.exe (make sure to copy test.rbf and test.rbs in the same directory)

2. Open a cmd and run an installer (has to be an autoelevating installer in c:\windows\insatller) this way "msiexec /fa c:\windows\installer\123123213.msi"

3. If all is successful it will write oops.dll to system32. If failed.. make sure to delete the following folders: config.msi, new, new2, new3.
Use the included video demo as guide... as the process is kind of complicated!

Filter I used in procmon:

You should see this on a successful run:

The mount point on c:\config.msi has to be create after querynetworkfile and before setsecurityfile.
