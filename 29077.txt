Full disclosure
Nov 27, 2017

Synopsis:
---
HikVision Wi-Fi IP cameras come with a default SSID "davinci", with a setting of no WiFi encryption or authentication. Depending on the firmware version, there is no configuration option within the camera to turn off Wi-Fi. If a camera is deployed via wired ethernet, then the WiFi settings wonat be adjusted, and a rogue AP with the SSID "davinci" can be associated to the camera to provide a new attack vector via WiFi to a wired network camera.

Risk:
---
The security exposure provides an unexpected attack surface via Wi-Fi in a camera deployed in a wired environment.  Devices running a firmware prior to v5.4.5 can be attacked via an access control bypass.  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/23

Mitigation:
---
The mitigation since the Wi-Fi cannot be turned off, is to specify a complex WPA2-PSK AES key.  With this the camera will try to associate to a wireless PSK that doesnat exist, and it is unlikely that the attacker will be able to guess the complex key.
Via the web interface:
Configuration -> Network -> Advanced Settings -> Wi-Fi
Set Security Mode to: aWPA2-personala
Set Encryption Type to: aAESa
Set Key 1 to: A random long string of characters
Enable WPS: Uncheck

Vulnerability details:
---
Tested Model Number (Confirmed): DS-2CD2432F-IW
Tested Firmware Versions (Confirmed): 5.3.0, 5.4.0, 5.4.5
Exploit:  Camera is hardwired via ethernet.  Wi-Fi is unconfigured (by default).
Set up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with an SSID of "davinci" with no encryption.
