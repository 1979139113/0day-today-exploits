Abstract

This issue allows an attacker to perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators&#039; session tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf.
 
Tested versions
This issue was successfully tested on the All in One SEO Pack WordPress Plugin version 2.3.6.1.
 
Fix
This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.7 of the plugin.
 
Introduction
All in One SEO Pack is reportedly the most downloaded plugin for WordPress. It allows users to automatically optimize their site for Search Engines. A stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the Bot Blocker functionality.
 
Details
A stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the Bot Blocker functionality of the All in One SEO Pack WordPress Plugin (1+ million active installs). Particularly interesting about this issue is that an anonymous user can simply store his XSS payload in the Admin dashboard by just visiting the public site with a malformed User Agent or Referrer header.
 
 
If the "Track Blocked Bots" setting is enabled (not by default), blocked request are logged in that HTML page without proper sanitization or output encoding, allowing XSS.
 
The affected resource: /all-in-one-seo-pack/modules/aioseop_bad_robots.php
 
if ( $this->option_isset( &#039;block_bots&#039; ) ) {
   if ( !$this->allow_bot() ) {
      status_header( 503 );
      $ip = $_SERVER[&#039;REMOTE_ADDR&#039;];
->      $user_agent = $_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_USER_AGENT&#039;];
->      $this->blocked_message( sprintf( __( "Blocked bot with IP %s -- matched user agent %s found in blocklist.",
->      &#039;all-in-one-seo-pack&#039; ), $ip, $user_agent ) );
      exit();
   } elseif ( $this->option_isset( &#039;block_refer&#039; ) && $this->is_bad_referer() ) {
      status_header( 503 );
      $ip = $_SERVER[&#039;REMOTE_ADDR&#039;];
->      $referer = $_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_REFERER&#039;];
->      $this->blocked_message( sprintf( __( "Blocked bot with IP %s -- matched referer %s found in blocklist.",
->      &#039;all-in-one-seo-pack&#039; ), $ip, $referer ) );
   }
}
 
The resulting HTML code:
 
 
Proof of concept
 
1/ Go to the "Bad Bot Blocker" settings page in All in one SEO menu.
2/ Enable "Block Bad Bots using HTTP" and/or "Block Referral Spam using HTTP".
3/ Send exploit request (with payload in referer or user-agent) to the server. Anywhere. Make sure to send your exploit request as an anonymous user. When you are logged in (have cookies), you are never seen as a bot.
4/ If all set up ok, your request will be blocked (HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable)
5/ Open the "Bad Bot Blocker" settings page as WP admin.
