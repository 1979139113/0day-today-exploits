{
}

Here's the definition of Entry.

struct Entry {
    const Identifier& propertyName;
    bool wasString;
    DestructuringPatternNode* pattern;
    BindingType bindingType;
};

The Identifier object created by "Identifier()" is in the stack. So it will get freed in the end of the appendEntry method.

PoC:
var {[a]: b, ...[]} = {};
