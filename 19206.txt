
Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Social Engine v4.2.5 web application.
The bug allows an attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). 
The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the add- new videos and classiefieds module with the bound vulnerable 
tag (keywords) parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (manager/admin) 
or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action but a privileged user account. 


Vulnerable Module(s):
                          [+] Add New Video
                          [+] Add New Classfields


Affected Module(s):
                          [+] Videos Listing Page
                          [+] Classfields Listing Page


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                          [+] Tags (keywords)


1.2
A non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the Social Engine v4.2.5 web application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium 
or high required user inter action or local low privileged user account. The bug is located in the  signup (profile) 
module with the bound vulnerable name and address parameters. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, 
client side phishing & client-side content request manipulation. Exploitation requires medium or high user inter 
action & without privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] Profile - Signup

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] Name & Address


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action & low privileged 
application user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...


- In the Post New Video Page (http://127.0.0.1:8080/videos/create) 
Information:  Copy & Paste persistent malicious script coe (js/html) into the Tags (keywords) field and save the context


- In the Post New Classfields Listing Page (http://127.0.0.1:8080/classifieds/create)
Information:  Copy & Paste persistent malicious script coe (js/html) into the Tags (keywords) field and save the context

1.2
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required 
user inter action and without privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ... 

Information:   Copy & Paste cross site scripting (script code) into the Profile Address Field of the signup form
URL:     http://127.0.0.1:8080/signup

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
