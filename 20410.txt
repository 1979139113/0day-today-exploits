*********************************************
Impact noted: 

-May cause problems to the owner. He becomes vulnerable when he goes in the banning section if an attacker successes to enter and makes a redirection to a malicious URL/script (EG. cookie stealer)

-May cause problems to the user. If the user's banned IP tries to connect to the website, he is vulnerable because the reason of the ban appears.If the ban reason field is infected
AND linked to this IP, the user incurs the risk of malicious redirection and/or undergoes bugs.

-As there is apparently no character limit, an XSS worm may be writable into these fields.
