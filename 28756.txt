# CVE: CVE-2017-15084 (R7-2017-22)
 
 
1. Description
 
 
2. Proof of concept
 
The MSF did not protect the logout form with csrf token, therefore i can logout any user by sending this url https://Metasploit-Server-IP:3790/logout
Here's an attack vector:

1) Set up a honeypot that detects MSF scans/attacks (somehow).
2) Once I get a probe, fire back a logout request.
3) Continue to logout the active user forever.
