Orb v2.0.01.0049-V2.54.0018 DirectShow DOS
==========================================

When Orb is first installed it registers several Direct Show filters with the system. When registered these filters are then called whenever a file which has a dependency on such a required filter is accessed. By specially crafting specific headers embedded into an mp3 file we can create a direct code path to code which is vulnerable to a integer division by zero. This vulnerability can be triggered remotely be embedding the crafted mp3 file into HTML. It is also not dependent on a certain media player. Attached is a PoC (Proof-Of-Concept) I wrote for this specific bug. Also included is a Rebuild file for IDA Pro examining the crash.
