Affected Product(s):
====================
Shumin Sun
Product: InstantCoder - iOS (Web-Application) 1.0
 
 
Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official InstantCoder v1.0 iOS mobile web-application (wifi).
The file include vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific path 
commands to compromise the mobile web-application.
 
The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `./toolkit/upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own 
files with malicious `filename` values in the `file upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local 
file/path include execution occcurs in the index file dir listing and sub folders of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to 
inject the lfi payload by usage of the wifi interface or local file sync function. 
 
Attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script code to execute different malicious 
attack requests. The attack vector is located on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST. 
 
The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4. 
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. 
Successful exploitation of the local file include vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.
 
Request Method(s):
                [+] [POST]
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] ./toolkit/upload
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] filename
 
Affected Module(s):
                [+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8080/)
 
 
 
1.2
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the official InstantCoder v1.0 iOS mobile web-application (wifi).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized access path variables to compromise the web-application or mobile device.
 
The directory traversal web vulnerability is located in the `path` value of the `listFiles` module. Remote attackers are able to 
manipulate the path variable GET or POST method request to compromise the application. The request method to inject the payload is 
POST and the request method to execute is GET. The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the application-side. The path 
variable is not encoded or parsed. Thus allows an attacker to inject to unauthorized access the local system or app path.
 
The security risk of the path traversal vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.0. 
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application (wifi ui) user account. 
Successful exploitation of the path traversal vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or compromise of connected device components.
 
 
Request Method(s):
                [+] [POST]
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] ./listFiles
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] path
 
Affected Module(s):
                [+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8080/)
 
 
Proof of Concept (PoC):
