~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

"Citrix Gateway is a customer-managed solution that can be deployed on
Platform.  Citrix Gateway provides users with secure access and single
sign-on to all the virtual, SaaS and web applications they need to be
productive." (see [1])

The solution contains a caching system which shows how long an entry
was in the cache.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Some responses of the web based solution are handled with an included
caching system.  This system can be seen in the HTTP response header.
The header also contains information, how long the response was in the
cache.  The number of seconds will never exceed the value of 112.
After that period of time, the cache will be refreshed with an
additional client request.

The "Via" header indicates that there is a caching system in place.  The
"Age" header shows how many seconds the initial request was processed.
A value of 1 indicates that the response is sent from the web server
instead of from the cache.
