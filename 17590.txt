Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities on the Wolf Content Management System v0.7.5 

Report-Timeline:
================
2012-02-11:  Vendor Notification
2012-02-27:  Public or Non-Public Disclosure

Affected Products:
==================
BlueWin CH
Product: Wolf CMS v0.7.5

Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on the Wolfs Content Management System v0.7.5. The 
vulnerability allows an remote attacker to execute own sql commands on the affected application 
dbms. Successful exploitation can result in dbms, web-server or application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] /plugins/comment/[Index]

1.2
Multiple persistent vulnerabilities are detected on the Wolfs Content Management System v0.7.5. 
The bug allows an remote attacker or local low privileged user account to inject persistent malicious 
script code on application side. Successful exploitation can result in persistent context manipulation 
on requests, session hijacking & account steal via application side phishing.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] /plugins/comment/

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers & local low privileged user accounts with- and 
without required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
Path:  /wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/
File:  index.php

Review:
271: $ip = isset($_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR&#039;]) ?
$_SERVER[&#039;HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR&#039;]:($_SERVER[&#039;REMOTE_ADDR&#039;]);


1.2
Path:  /wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/
File:  index.php

Review:
/wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/index.php
272: echo &#039;<input type="hidden" value="&#039;.$ip.&#039;" name="comment[author_ip]" />&#039;;


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the blind sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistant xss vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
