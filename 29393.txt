Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered multiple remote sql-injection vulnerabilities in the iJoomla (Joomla) com_adagency 6.0.9 component.


Affected Product(s):
====================
iJoomla
Product: com_adagency - Component (Joomla) 6.0.9


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple remote sql-injection vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official iJoomla com_adagency v6.0.9 content management system component.
The sql-injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own sql commands to compromise the database management system or web-application.

The sql-injection vulnerabilities are located in the `advertiser_status` and `status_select` parameters of the `com_adagency` component module.
Remote attackers are able to perform malicious GET method request to execute sql command via vulnerable parameters. Remote attackers can trigger 
the issue depending on the access privileges with a restricted or unauthenticated user account. The vulnerability is a classic remote select sql 
injection vulnerability in the `com_adagency` component module.

The security risk of the sql-injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.1.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server and web-application compromise.

Request Method(s):
