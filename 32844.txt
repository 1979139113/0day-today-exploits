~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

2.4 GHz radio communication.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows [1]:

"Brilliant red laser pointer helps you get their attention - and keep
it."

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless
injection attacks.

Vulnerability Details:

Presentation Remote is vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data packets
receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used protocol. By knowing
the used data protocol, it is possible to inject packets in the data
receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
in-house developed software tool in combination with the USB radio
dongle Crazyradio PA and the nrf-research-firmware by Bastille Networks
Internet Security [2, 3].

The following output of the developed proof-of-concept software tool
illustrates a successful attack:
