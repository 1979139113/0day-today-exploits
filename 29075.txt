﻿Vulnerability Summary
The following advisory describes a remote command execution vulnerability
found in Synology StorageManager.
 
Storage Manager is “a management application that helps you organize and
monitor the storage capacity on your Synology NAS. Depending on the model
and number of installed hard drives, Storage Manager helps you accomplish
the following tasks:
 
Create different types of RAID and non-RAID storage configurations, such as
volumes, disk/RAID groups, iSCSI LUNs, and iSCSI Targets.
Monitor the overall storage usage of your Synology NAS.
Inspect the health of installed hard drives and solid state drives.
Use advanced options, such as hot spare drives, SSD TRIM, SSD cache, and
more.”
