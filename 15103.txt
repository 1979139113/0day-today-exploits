Remote attackers can gain sensitive information about a DD-WRT router and internal clients, including IP addresses, MAC addresses and host names. This information can be used for further network attacks as well as very accurate MAC address geolocation (see: http://samy.pl/mapxss/). This is exploitable even if remote administration is disabled.

Since DD-WRT is also vulnerable to a public IP DNS rebinding attack, this vulnerability affects routers that have remote administration disabled as well, and can be exploited by any Web site that is viewed by an internal, unauthenticated user. The Rebind tool easily facilitates this type of rebinding attack (http://rebind.googlecode.com).
