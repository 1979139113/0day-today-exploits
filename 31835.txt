1. Description

Certain Secure Access SA Series SSL VPN products (originally developed by
Juniper Networks but now sold and supported by Pulse Secure, LLC) allow

appropriate controls are not performed.


2. Proof of Concept

It is possible to change the administrator user password from readonly user
because the appropriate controls are not performed. Save the page
/dana-admin/user/update.cgi in local, change the "user" value and save
changes.
