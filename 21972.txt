CVE: CVE-2014-1216
Vendor: Fitnesse
Product: Wiki
Affected version: v20131110 and earlier
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Jerzy Kramarz

Details:

The Fitnesse wiki does not validate the syntax of edited pages to
validate whether the pages are introducing any extra parameters that
could be executed in the context of the application. This vulnerability
could be exploited by remote attackers to introduce external commands
into the workflow of the application that would execute them.
