III. PROOF OF CONCEPT

Cross site scripting
*********************

Vulnerability description
___________________________

This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an 
attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user.
Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute
the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser. 

This vulnerability affects

/rus/about/community/unicolours/frame.wbp. (46)

The impact of this vulnerability
__________________________________
An attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker&#039;s choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the 

administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.

How to fix this vulnerability
_________________________________
Check if this form requires CSRF protection and implement CSRF countermeasures if necessary.
