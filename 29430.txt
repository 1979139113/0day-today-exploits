Description
-----------
 
Plugin implements the AJAX action `wpdm-install-addon` which calls the
function `wpdm_install_addon`. This function doesn&#039;t take any anti-CSRF
measures thus making it susceptible to those kind of attacks.
 
What is interesting about this function though, is the fact that it
provides plugin installation functionality for admin users. The origin of
the package is defined by the `$_REQUEST[&#039;addon&#039;]` if is set without any
validation.
 
A malicious actor can exploit this to install a malicious plugin in the
vulnerable site. In fact the install package doesn&#039;t need to be a valid
plugin, it could just contain malicious code. Because the package is
extracted in the `/wp-content/plugins/` dir without changing it&#039;s original
folder structure, an attacker could leverage the CSRF to upload malicious
code and execute the code on the infected server.
