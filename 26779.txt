# Version: Windows 7 x64 Ultimate Build 7601 Service Pack 1 Without any updates
# Tested on: Windows 7 x64 Ultimate Build 7601 SP1 Without any updates, Power Point 2016 MSO 16.0.4266.1001 64-bit professional plus and Java Version 8 Update 101 (build 1.8.0_101-b13).
 
 
 
To exploit this issue:
 
2 - Insert object and choose "create from file" and choose the jar payload.
3 - On the insert tab, click action and in both "mouse over" and "mouse click" tabs choose "object action" and choose "activate"
4 - Scale the object to fit the whole slide so when the user opens the file it mouse will be over it, and just in case also if the user clicks it will open the jar file.
5 - Save the file as ppsx file.

Please note that in a fully patched version a pop up will show asking the user to run the file which is useful if you&#039;re good at social engineering ;)
