The SEA stated that this distribution is not to be used as a server, in order to secure network connections against port 80, modify the apache configuration to bind to localhost:80. This is a misconfiguration and will be fixed in the next release.

Modify ports.conf in the following way:
# cat ports.conf |grep -n 127
8:NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80
9:Listen 127.0.0.1:80

The tools appear to be developed in PHP & Perl and are web based.
They are served through a local apache instance running on the desktop system
The apache webserver listening on 0.0.0.0:80 allowing remote access to all of the tools in their catalog. These tools allow remote command execution and file uploads, it was the intent of the SEA to have these only accessable to the local user.

This apache server is a tool server hosting web based tools by the SEA
One of the tools is a web shell to the system
 
The path http://192.168.0.33/tools/sea.php is a webshell, meant to be accessable only locally but due to a misconfiguration is available remotely. 
 
Here is a screen shot after logging in: 
 
From lines 6-15 contain the credentials sea.php:
      6 $user = 'SEA'; ^M
      7 $pass = 'SEA'; ^M
      8 $uselogin = 1;^M
      9 $sh3llColor = "#0040FF";^M
     10 ^M
     11 # MySQL Info ---------^M
     12 $DBhost = "localhost";^M
     13 $DBuser = "root";^M
     14 $DBpass = "root";^M
     15 #---------------------^M


Looks like an uploader script too at http://192.168.0.33/tools/uploader.php
