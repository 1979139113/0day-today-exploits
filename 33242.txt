(from the vendor&#039;s homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS

installation vulnerable.

Since all access levels from Subscriber (the lowest possible rights) to Admin
basically have access to the plugin, it is possible to escalate privileges quite easily.

To name just a few vulnerable endpoints:

/wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-scores&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=slickquiz-edit&id=(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)


6. RISK
=======
The vulnerability can be used by an authenticated attacker (lowest possible
rights of Subscriber are sufficient) to read sensitive contents from the backend
database and therefore compromise all kinds of information, which is stored in
the database. This could be sensitive authentication information like passwords
or customer and employee information like email addresses and could also be used
installation via the plugin functionality.


7. SOLUTION
===========
None (Remove the plugin)
