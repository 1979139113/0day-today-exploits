
To reproduce the bug:

1) install and run frida on the caller Android device and a desktop host (https://www.frida.re)
2) copy the filed in the attached directory to /data/local/tmp/packs/, so that /data/local/tmp/packs/opack0 exists
3) run "setenforce 0" on the caller device
4) extract replay.py and replay.js into the same directory on a desktop host and run:

python3 replay.py DEVICENAME

Wait for the word "READY" to display.

If you don't know your device name, you can list device names by running:

python3 replay.py

5) start a voice call and answer it on the target device. A crash will occur in about 10 seconds.

A crash log is attached.
