Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in ManageEngines ServiceDesk v8.0 Plus web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Two vulnerabilities are located in the my details and request new incidents module of the web front-end with the bound
vulnerable name, subject and description parameters. Exploitation requires low user inter action & low privileged
customer web application user account. The secound part of the bugs are located in the New Contract, Access points and
Create Solution module of the admin/moderator back-end with the bound vulnerable title, asset name, contract name, description
or support name. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (customer/manager/admin), persistent
phishing or stable (persistent) web context manipulation.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action
& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
The vulnerability in the Requester account can be exploited by many different methods. The first attacking vector can be
launched by creating a request and injecting a malicious code in the subject and description field of the request. When
the victim views the requests and stops by the mouse courser on the request name. The code gets executed in the small
pop up window that contains the Subject and Description information of the request. Another way to attack the admin is to
edit the details of the requester account and inject the malicious code in the field "Name". After that, the attacker
creates a request. Once the admin views the requests, the code gets executed in the field of the requester name.
 
 
Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
