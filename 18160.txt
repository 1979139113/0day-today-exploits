Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System.

Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Pritlog v0.821 Content Management System. The
bugs
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful
exploitation
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.
Exploitation requires
low user inter action. Attackers can inject malicious strings as author name to execute them when an admin is
or manage the listing of users. The bug is located on application side & the execution is persistent out of the user

management web
application context.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or
reproduce ..
