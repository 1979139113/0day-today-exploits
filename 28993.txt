Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use this device in production until a thorough
security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved. The device must not be accessible from
untrusted networks.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authentication Bypass (client-side "authentication" enforcement)
The web interface (TCP port 80) suffers from an authentication bypass
vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to access arbitray
functionality and information (i.e. password lists) available through
the webserver.


2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
The web interface provides a "ping" functionality. This form is
vulnerable to reflected cross-site-scripting because of missing input
handling and output encoding.


3) Outdated Webserver (GoAhead)
The used webserver version contains known weaknesses.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authentication Bypass
Use a browser which has JavaScript disabled  ("Authentication" checks are
performed client-side) and open legitimate URLs directly.

Examples:
http://<hostname>/start.asp
http://<hostname>/pwliste.asp
http://<hostname>/goform/webforms_readmem?start_addr=0&length=100


2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
All parameters in "webforms_ping" are vulnerable to reflected XSS:
http://<hostname>/goform/webforms_ping?ip_address=1.1.1.com%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27XSS%20proof-of-concept%27)%3C/script%3E1&length_data=32&count_pings=4&timeout=1


3) Outdated Webserver
The used version of "GoAhead" webserver is 2.1.7 (released in Oct. 2003)
This version has known vulnerabilities:

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
SM-2556 COM Modules with the firmware variants ENOS00, ERAC00,
ETA2, ETLS00, MODi00 and DNPi00
(FW 1549 Revision 07)
