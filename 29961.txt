3. Vulnerability Description
============================
During the security analysis of Magento Open Source 2 prior to 2.0.18
it was discovered that the application returns unescaped and
unsanitized user/customer controlled input on direct requests to
several application URLs.

User/customer controlled information such as customer first and last
name, street address, city, company, shipping and billing information
are unsanitized and unescaped in an output resulted from a direct
request to the following url:

http://website.com/admin/mui/index/render/?namespace=customer_listing&isAjax=true

User/customer first and last name information is unsanitized and
unescaped in an output resulted from a direct request to the
following urls:

http://website.com/admin/mui/index/render/?namespace=customer_online_grid&isAjax=true

http://website.com/admin/mui/index/render/?namespace=sales_order_invoice_grid&isAjax=true

http://website.com/admin/mui/index/render/?namespace=sales_order_grid&isAjax=true

The application will return a text/html response with a json-formatted
content. All aforementioned user-controlled input is prone to stored
cross-site scripting.

option is disabled. Secret keys are an additional anti-CSRF measure in
Magento, with form keys being the primary measure (that can not be
disabled). In a team setting this option is often disabled in order
to be able to to pass admin links to coleagues, tickets, chat, etc.
