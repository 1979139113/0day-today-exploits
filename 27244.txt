Western Digital My Cloud is a low-cost entry-level network-attached storage device. It was discovered that the Western Digital My Cloud is affected by Cross-Site Request Forgery. When combined with command injection (see advisory SFY201703) this issue allows an attacker to gain complete control (root access) of the affected device.

This issue exists due to the fact that the My Cloud device lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to lure an authenticated My Cloud device user (some command injections require an admin user whereas others also allow users with fewer privileges) into executing a malicious link crafted to exploit a command injection in a vulnerable My Cloud device.
