
CVE Number

CVE-2018-4070, CVE-2018-4071

Summary

An exploitable Information Disclosure vulnerability exists in the ACEManager EmbeddedAceGet_Task.cgi functionality of Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause an information disclosure, resulting in the exposure of confidential information, including, but not limited to, plaintext passwords and SNMP community strings. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request, or run the binary, to trigger this vulnerability.

Details

Sierra Wireless is a wireless communications equipement designer and manufacturer. They provide both embedded solutions as well as wireless hardware solutions, including both the ES450 and GX450 devices. The AirLink ES450 is a LTE gateway designed for distributed enterprise. The ES450 is typically seen connecting Point-of-sale devices, remote SCADA equipment, or other business critical equipment. The AirLink ES450 also provides a terminal server for remote out-of-band administration.

ACEManager is the web server included with the AirLink ES450. This web server is responsible for the majority of interactions in the device. Some specific capabilities of the web server are routing, device reconfiguration, user authentication and certificate management. The vendor has stated that the ACEManager web application is not accessible by default from the Cellular WAN.

These vulnerabilities were discovered and tested using the AirLink ES450. Most likely this vulnerabilities also affects the AirLink GX450 product as well.
CVE-2018-4070

The EmbeddedAceGet_Task.cgi executable is used to retrieve MSCII configuration values within the configuration manager of the AirLink ES450. This binary does not have any restricted configuration settings, so once the MSCIID is discovered, any authenticated user can send configuration changes using the /cgi-bin/Embedded_Ace_Get_Task.cgi endpoint. The following request shows the MSCIID for retrieving the user password for the device in plaintext.

This binary has -rwxr-xr-x permissions which allows the binary to be executed outside of the web user interface as well, such as if a user logs in over SSH. This allows a low-privilege user to retrieve the password of other users on the system, status of services, and retrieve any other configuration on the device.
