     Affected Vendor: Barracuda
     Affected Product: Web Application Firewall V360
     Affected Version: Firmware v8.0.1.014
     Platform: Embedded Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
     Impact: Root Access
     Attack vector: Grub

2. Vulnerability Description

     Firmware reversing of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall
     uncovered debug features that should have been removed on the
     production images. Appending a debugging statement onto a grub
     configuration line leads to an early boot root shell.

3. Technical Description

     After the initramfs image has been decrypted (see
     https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/5fonrm/rooting_an_appliance_for_fun/dandnx2/),
     some extra kernel command-line options are checked for by init.

       # cat init|more
       [snip]
       Some interesting things you can do at the kernel command line:

          * oldscheme - Choose the "old" partitioning scheme.
          * decrypt - Specify that the main partitions are encrypted.
          * shell - Run /sbin/init when we're done setting things up.
          * wyldstallyns - (soon) better debugging
       [snip]

     Investigating them further, we find a specific comparison looking for
     wlydstallyns=69dude.

       # grep -ri "wyldstallyns" *
       lib/Barracuda/Preboot/Utils.pm:        $self->{WYLDSTALLYNS} = 1 if $cmd eq "wyldstallyns=69dude";

     This perl module is imported and used during system init.

       # grep "Barracuda::Preboot::Utils" init
       use Barracuda::Preboot::Utils qw/try catch/;

     If the kernel line contains the debugging statement, a DEBUG variable is set to one.

       # cat lib/Barracuda/Preboot/Utils.pm
       [snip]
       $self->{DEBUG}                  = 1 if $self->{WYLDSTALLYNS};
       [snip]

     This variables determines whether or not the bash shell is executed during early boot.

       # cat init
       [snip]
       eval {
           parse_args($init);
           init( $dialog, $init, $iso );
           main( $dialog, $init, $iso, $tools );
           boot( $dialog, $init, $iso );
       } or do {
           if ( defined $init->{DEBUG} ) {
               print $@;
               exec "/bin/bash";
           }
           else {
               $dialog->hang($@);
           }
       };
       [snip]

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has patched this vulnerability in the lastest
     virtual appliance release.

     2017.06.27 - Barracuda informs KoreLogic that the issue has
                  been fixed in the latest release of the WAF
                  virtual appliance.
     2017.07.06 - KoreLogic public disclosure.

7. Proof of Concept

     Start by rebooting, hit 'e' during the grub boot menu. When
     prompted for credentials, provide: root / bimg. Now, on the
     linux line append wyldstallyns=69dude

     Hit F10 when finished.

     During the boot process you will be prompted with: Paused
     (continue|exit)

     When you type exit, you are dropped into a root shell.

     root@(none):~#
