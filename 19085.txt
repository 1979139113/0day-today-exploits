Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected  in Manage Engines Mobile Application Manager v10.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the DetailsView.do or Search.do
module(s) and the bound vulnerable parameters showMGDetails&groupId & viewName. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities
result in dbms & application compromise via sql injection attack.
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
