# Version: 4.8.1
# Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04
# CVE: CVE-2018-12613

# 1. Description: 

# An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).

# 2. Proof of Concept:

import requests

# input the target
VALID_PHPMYADMIN_URL = ""

# input a valid session (After authentification)
VALID_PHPMYADMIN_SESSION = ""

burp0_url = VALID_PHPMYADMIN_URL + "/import.php"

# 3. Solution:

# Upgrade to version 4.8.2 or above.
