1) Affected Software

* LibRaw versions prior to 0.18.7.

======================================================================
2) Severity

Rating: Moderately critical
Impact: Denial of Service
Where:  From remote

======================================================================
3) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in LibRaw,
which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of
Service).

1) An off-by-one error within the "LibRaw::kodak_ycbcr_load_raw()"
function (internal/dcraw_common.cpp) can be exploited to cause a heap-
based buffer overflow and subsequently cause a crash.

2) An   error   within   the   "LibRaw::unpack()"   function
(src/libraw_cxx.cpp) can be exploited to trigger a NULL pointer
dereference.

3) An   error   within   the   "kodak_radc_load_raw()"   function
(internal/dcraw_common.cpp) related to the "buf" variable can be
exploited to  cause  an out-of-bounds read memory access  and
subsequently cause a crash.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the library to
be compiled with the "-O0" compilation flag.

The vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 0.18.6 and reported in
versions prior to 0.18.7.
