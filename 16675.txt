WebsiteBaker 2.8.1  <= Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability
=======================================================================
 
 
1. OVERVIEW
 
WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
 
 
2. BACKGROUND
 
WebsiteBaker is a PHP-based Content Management System (CMS) designed with one goal in mind: to enable its users to produce websites with ease.
 
 
3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
 
WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw exists because the application does not require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the application, without further prompting or verification.
