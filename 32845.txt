Vulnerability Details:

vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data
packets of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless
protocol. By knowing the used data protocol, it is possible to inject
keystrokes by the receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim&#039;s
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim&#039;s computer that is operated with an affected receiver of
