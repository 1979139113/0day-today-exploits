1. Description

Samsung Software Update Service, SWUpdateService (SWMAgent.exe), installs as a service with 
an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.


2. Proof of Concept

C:\>sc qc SWUpdateService
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
SERVICE_NAME: SWUpdateService
  TYPE               : 110  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS (interactive)
  START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
  ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
  BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\ProgramData\Samsung\SW Update Service\SWMAgent.exe /SERVICE
  LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
  TAG                : 0
  DISPLAY_NAME       : SW Update Service
  DEPENDENCIES       :
  SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem 


3. Exploit:
 
A successful attempt would require the local attacker must insert an executable file
in the path of the service.
Upon service restart or system reboot, the malicious code will be run with elevated privileges.
