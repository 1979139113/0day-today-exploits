1. Description

In Vignette Content Management version 6, it's possible to gain
administrator privileges by discovering the admin password in the
vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin HTML source code,
and then creating a privileged user account.


2. Proof of Concept

http://X.X.X.X/vgn/ccb/user/mgmt/user/edit/0,1628,0,00.html?uid=admin.

Once you authenticate you change the user by the administrator (uid =
admin) and you will see the asterisks in the password field that you can
use to authenticate later and create administrator users or modify any
feature of the CMS. I discovered this vulnerability in 2005.


3. Solution:
