plugins for WordPress.

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities. 
These XSS holes are in ZeroClipboard.swf, which is used in the plugin. In

(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/103) and in multiple web 
applications.

In plugin folder and subfolders (at web sites where showing errors is off 
and they are saving into error_log).
