 <b>Description:
 This ocx contains a lot of extreme dangerous methods. Theese two are very interesting, they are:
 "StartProcess()" and "SyncShell()"
 Using one of them, you&#039;ll be able to run every program you like, simply giving to the method the 
 right argument.
 In this PoC, I use the "StartProcess()" method to execute the calc.exe, but you can do everything
 you like.
 Anyway, I think you could imagine what impact could have this kind of vulnerability :D

 Other dangerous methods of this ocx are:
 "SaveAs()"
 "CABDefaultURL()"
 "CABFileName()"
 "CABRunFile()"</b>
