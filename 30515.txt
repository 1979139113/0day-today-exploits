3. *Vulnerability Description*

>From Quest KACE&#039;s website:

"The KACE Systems Management Appliance [1]  provides
devices, including servers, PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, tablets, printers,
storage, networking gear and the Internet of Things (IoT). KACE can fulfill
all of your organization&#039;s systems management needs, from initial deployment
to ongoing management and retirement."

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Quest KACE System Management
Virtual Appliance that would allow a remote attacker to gain command
one that can be exploited as an unauthenticated user.

Additional web application vulnerabilities were found in the web console
that is bundled with the product. These vulnerabilities are detailed in
section 7.

Note: This advisory has limited details on the vulnerabilities because
during the attempted coordinated disclosure process, Quest advised us not
to distribute our original findings to the public or else they would
take legal action. Quest&#039;s definition of "responsible disclosure" can be
found at
https://support.quest.com/essentials/reporting-security-vulnerability.

CoreLabs has been publishing security advisories since 1997 and believes
in coordinated disclosure and good faith collaboration with software vendors
before disclosure to help ensure that a fix or workaround solution is ready
and available when the vulnerability details are publicized. We believe
that providing technical details about each finding is necessary to provide
users and organizations with enough information to understand the
implications
of the vulnerabilities against their environment and, most importantly, to
prioritize the remediation activities aiming at mitigating risk.

We regret Quest&#039;s posture on disclosure during the whole process (detailed
in the Report Timeline section) and the lack of a possibility of engaging
into a coordinated publication date, something we achieve (and have
achieved) with many vendors as part of our coordinated disclosure practices.

6. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Leandro Barragan
and Guido Leo from Core Security Consulting Services. The publication of
this advisory was coordinated by Leandro Cuozzo from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Quest KACE SMA ships with a web console that provides administrators and
users with several features. Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the
context of this console, both from an authenticated and unauthenticated
perspective.

Section 7.1 describes how an unauthenticated attacker could gain command
execution on the system as the web server user.

Vulnerabilities described in 7.2 and 7.3 could also be abused to gain code
execution but would require the attacker to have a valid authentication
token.

7.5 would allow the attacker to elevate his privileges from the web server
user to root, effectively obtaining full control of the device.

Additional web application vulnerabilities were found in the console, such
as insufficient authorization for critical functions, which would allow an
anonymous attacker to reconfigure the appliance (7.6), SQL injection
vulnerabilities (7.7, 7,8), a cross-site scripting issue (7.9), and path
traversal vulnerabilities, which would allow an attacker to read, write and
delete arbitrary files (7.9, 7.10, 7.11).

7.1. *Unauthenticated command injection*

[CVE-2018-11138]
The &#039;/common/download_agent_installer.php&#039; script is accessible to anonymous
users in order to download an agent for a specific platform. This behavior
can be abused to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

The script receives the following parameters via the GET method:

. platform: Indicates the platform in which the agent is going to be
installed
. serv: SHA256 hash of a fixed value that depends of each appliance
. orgid: Organization ID
. version: Version number of the agent

The last two conditions are simple to meet. The Agent versions are publicly
available within the Quest KACE site, but even if they were not, we found
that the Organization ID parameter is vulnerable to a time based SQL
injection
(refer to issue 7.7).
This would make it possible to obtain the agent version by querying the
table &#039;CLIENT_DISTRIBUTION&#039; and fetching the contents of the &#039;VERSION&#039;
column. The Organization ID is 1 by default, but could be obtained in the
same way as the Agent version by querying the table &#039;ORGANIZATION&#039; and
the column &#039;ID&#039;.

As stated above, the application uses the Organization ID and Agent
version parameters to execute commands. This means we need to find a way
to append system commands within the Organization ID, without breaking the
SQL query. If we use the comment symbol (#), we can append anything we want
without affecting the result of the query.

-i");};&#039;;
- version = 8.0.152 (last agent version available for windows)

7.2. *Authenticated command injection*

[CVE-2018-11139]
The &#039;/common/ajax_email_connection_test.php&#039; script used to test the
configured
SMTP server is accessible by any authenticated user and can be abused to
execute arbitrary commands on the system. This script is vulnerable to
command injection via the unsanitized user input &#039;TEST_SERVER&#039; sent to the
script via POST method.

7.3. *PHP Object Injection leading to arbitrary command execution*

[CVE-2018-11135]
An authenticated user could abuse a deserialization call on the script
&#039;/adminui/error_details.php&#039; to inject arbitrary PHP objects.

To exploit this issue, the parameter &#039;ERROR_MESSAGES&#039; needs to be an array
and meet some specific conditions in order to successfully exploit the
issue.

7.4. *Privilege escalation via password change in Sudo Server*

[CVE-2018-11134]
In order to perform actions that requires higher privileges, the application
relies on a message queue managed that runs with root privileges and only
allows a set of commands.

One of the available commands allows to change any user&#039;s password
(including root).

Assuming we are able to run commands in the server, we could abuse this
feature by changing the password of the &#039;kace_support&#039; account, which
comes disabled by default but has full sudo privileges.

7.5. *Privilege escalation via command injection in Sudo Server*

[CVE-2018-11132]
As mentioned in the issue [7.4], in order to perform actions that require
higher privileges, the application relies on a message queue that runs
daemonized with root privileges and only allows a set of commands to be
executed.

A command injection vulnerability exists within this message queue which
allows us to append arbitrary commands that will be run as root.

7.6. *Insufficient Authorization for critical function*

[CVE-2018-11142]
&#039;systemui/settings_network.php&#039; and &#039;systemui/settings_patching.php&#039;
scripts are accessible only from localhost. This restriction can be bypassed
by modifying the &#039;Host&#039; and &#039;X_Forwarded_For&#039; HTTP headers.

The following proof of concept abuses this vulnerability to shutdown the
server as an anonymous user:

/-----
POST /systemui/settings_network.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
X-Forwarded-For: ::1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

7.7. *Unauthenticated SQL Injection in download_agent_installer.php*

[CVE-2018-11136]
The &#039;orgID&#039; parameter received by the &#039;/common/download_agent_installer.php&#039;
script is not sanitized, leading to SQL injection. In particular, a blind
time based type.

The following proof of concept induces a time delay:

/-----

7.8. *SQL Injection in run_report.php*

[CVE-2018-11140]
The &#039;reportID&#039; parameter received by the &#039;/common/run_report.php&#039; script
is not sanitized, leading to SQL injection. In particular, an error based
type.

7.9. *Unauthenticated Cross Site Scriting in run_cross_report.php*

[CVE-2018-11133]
The &#039;fmt&#039; parameter of the &#039;/common/run_cross_report.php&#039; script is
vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

The following proof of concept demonstrates the vulnerability:

/-----

be abused to read arbitrary files with &#039;www&#039; privileges. The following proof
of concept reads the &#039;/etc/passwd&#039; file. No administrator privileges are
needed to execute this script.

It is worth noting that there are several interesting files that can be
read with &#039;www&#039; privileges, such as all the files located in
&#039;/kbox/bin/koneas/keys/&#039; and &#039;/kbox/kboxwww/include/globals.inc&#039;,
which contain plaintext passwords.

7.11. *Path traversal in advisory.php leading to arbitrary file
creation/deletion*

[CVE-2018-11141]
The &#039;IMAGES_JSON&#039; and &#039;attachments_to_remove[]&#039; parameters of the
&#039;/adminui/advisory.php&#039; script can be abused to write and delete files
respectively. The following proof of concept creates a file located at
&#039;/kbox/kboxwww/resources/TestWrite&#039; with the content &#039;Sarasa&#039; (base64
encoded).
Files can be at any location where the &#039;www&#039; user has write permissions.

File deletion could be abused to delete
&#039;/kbox/kboxwww/systemui/reports/setup_completed.log&#039; file. This file&#039;s
existence defines if the appliance setup wizard is shown or not.
