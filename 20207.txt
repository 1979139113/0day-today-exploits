97: $filepart = fileinformation( $_FILES['postimage']['name'] );
98: $filename = $filepart['basename'];
99: // check if this filename already exist in the folder
100: $i = 2;
101: while ( in_array( $filename, $imageslist ) ) {
102: $filename = $filepart['filename'] . '_' . $i++ . '.' .$filepart['extension'];
