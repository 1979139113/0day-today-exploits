Vulnerability Details:
The password is reflected to DOM and is readable through the "value" field of the SMTP user settings in notifications tab. You have to be authenticated to access the configuration tab. 

Risk:
An attacker gets access to the configured mailbox. Because of Sophos UTM is a multi user system, this is a problem in bigger company environments with splitted admin rights. The surface scope is changed, because in bigger environments you are getting access to the configured mailbox, which results in an integrity loss. 

Steps to reproduce:
See vulnerability details.
