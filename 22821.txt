CVE: CVE-2014-7958, CVE-2014-7959, CVE-2014-8749
Vendor: AITpro
Product: bulletproof-security
Affected version: bulletproof-security <= .51
Vulnerabilities fixed in version: .51.1

Details:


xss vulnerability (CVE-2014-7958):

POST /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php
HTTP/1.1



SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-7959, correct db username and
password is required in order to exploit this):

HTTP/1.1




SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2014-8749)


POST /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php
HTTP/1.1

Possible scenario:

- the user sends a request with username, password, host and other
parameters to the vulnerable page
- the server doesn&#039;t check the host parameter to be in a whitelist of
permitted databases
- the server performs an authentication request to a remote or
internal network database and gives back to the attacker the
authentication result
-After n attemps the attacker has bypassed access restrictions (if
any) to the remote database, discovered the remote database password,
and made it appear bulletproof-security as the source of the attack.

Extra step:
-If the sql injection flaw (CVE-2014-7959) is not fixed, an attacker
could also execute arbitrary sql statement on the remote server, as
the vulnerable page executes a query if the authentication is
of the attack would appear to be the bulletproof-security vulnerable
site.
