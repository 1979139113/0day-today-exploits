CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Description
================
Path traversal in Photo Gallery may allow admins to read most files on the filesystem

Vulnerability
================
The plugin contains a file manager component which allows broad access to the filesystem including deleting files, uploading files, and moving files. In this proof-of-concept weall be usingA pathA traversal to copy a configurationA file from /etc into a web-readable directory in order to allow the attacker to read secrets.

Proof of concept
================

Visit:A http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=galleries_bwg
Click Add new then Add Images
Right-click on the file manager overlay, click Inspect, and use the dev tools to get the URL of this iframe
RemoveA &extensions=jpg%2Cjpeg%2Cpng%2Cgif from the URL
Append &dir=/../../../../../../etc/ to the URL
Visit that URL
Select the passwd fileA by clicking on it once
Press the copy button in the toolbar
Press the up button repeatedly until you arrive back at wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery
Press the paste button
VisitA http://localhost/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/passwdA to read the list of users

The number of ../A you need to add to the URL will vary,A and the web serverA may be configured to only allowA reading files with certain extensions.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.3.43 or later.
