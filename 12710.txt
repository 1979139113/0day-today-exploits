=============
"Subdreamer CMS is a web based content management system."

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in Subdreamer
CMS, which can be exploited to conduct sql injection attacks.
Input passed directly to the "categoryids[]" POST parameter in
"/admin/pages.php?action=update_pages" is not properly sanitised before
being used in a SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL
queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and
therefore sanatize all input. Edit the source code to ensure that input
is properly sanitised.
