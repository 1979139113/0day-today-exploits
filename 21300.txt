The parameter "SystemCmd" in the URL below causes the device to execute arbitrary commands. (The value encoded in the example is `nvram show`)
 
 
The URL should be submitted as a `GET` request.
 
Console output can be observed by sending a `GET` request to `http://192.168.1.1/cmdRet_check.htm` after calling the URL above, if so desired.
 
The URLs above are protected with HTTP Basic Access Authentication. If a victim has logged in to the router recently, the exploit will work without further intervention. Otherwise, attackers can try supplying default credenitals in the URL.
