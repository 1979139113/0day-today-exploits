Software: Post Indexer
Version: 3.0.6.1
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/unserialisation-in-post-indexer-could-allow-man-in-the-middle-to-execute-arbitrary-code-in-some-circumstances/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 7.6 (High; AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
Unserialisation in Post Indexer could allow man-in-the-middle to execute arbitrary code (in some circumstances)

Vulnerability
================



This code is called twice a day by wp_schedule_event(time(), \'twicedaily\', \'wpmudev_scheduled_jobs\')A (extra/wpmudev-dash-notification.php):



$url = $this->server_url . \'?action=check&un-version=3.3.3&wp=\' . urlencode($wp) . \'&bcount=\' . $blog_count . \'&domain=\' . urlencode(network_site_url()) . $projects; // line 393
$response = wp_remote_get($url, $options); // line 400
$data = $response[\'body\']; // line 402
$data = unserialize($data); // line 404
There is a class called ProcessLocker in this pluginA with an exploitableA __destructA method, which could be used as a jumping-off point for attacks using this unserialize()A vulnerability (or the use ofA unserialize()A in WordPress core which requires access to the database to exploit).

Proof of concept
================
AchievingA arbitrary code executionA depends onA which classes are available (i.e. which plugins and themes are installed and active). It wonat be possible in all situations.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.0.6.2 or later.
