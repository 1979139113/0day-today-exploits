~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Password Safe and Repository Enterprise is a password management
software for companies with many features.

The vendor MATESO GmbH describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Manage your passwords in the company according to your security needs!
Features such as password policies, multi-eyes principle, workflow and
task system makes management productive and safe.

The integrated rights management system with data transfer option and
automatic synchronization with Active Directory ensures that your
employees can only access data which they are entitled to."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that synchronized databases (offline databases)
created by a specific user also contain sensitive data of other users,
for example login credentials.

The password information of other users are stored as raw, unsalted MD5
hash values in the database table tdUsers (see SYSS-2015-037).

Thus, by having access to an offline database, it is possible to access
password information of other users, for example the MD5 password hash
of the built-in administrator account. This password information may be
recovered during password guessing attacks and used for accessing
foreign user data in an unauthorized way or for performing privilege
escalation attacks in the online mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

In the offline mode of the password management software Password Safe
and Repository, it is possible to manipulate SQL statements due to
the violation of secure design principles and SQL injection
vulnerabilities (see SYSS-2015-035).

By using the following SQL statement, user information of all users
unnecessarily stored in the database table tdUsers can be retrieved from
an offline database and extracted from memory of the password management
software, for example by using a modified client software:

SELECT * FROM tdUsers

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The MATESO GmbH released the new software version Password Safe and
Repository Enterprise 8 that is not affected by the described security
issues.

Please contact the manufacturer for further information or support.
