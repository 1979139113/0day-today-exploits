I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
 
  
II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
2.2.0
 
 
III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
Alter the value of cookies called &#039;default_news&#039; or &#039;sponsors&#039; and then view a site page which includes controllers/index.ctrl.php or controllers/settings.ctrl.php that will render the cookies as they exist on the user&#039;s machine.
 
 
IV. NOTES
---------------------------------------
* The &#039;default_news&#039; cookie doesn&#039;t require a user to be authenticated whereas &#039;sponsors&#039; does
* The disclosure date was pushed a full month so that a fix could be released but no update was released yet
 
 
V. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
Upgrade to a release > 2.2.0 when available or otherwise disable cookie rendering.
