MLdonkey <= 2.9.7 HTTP DOUBLE SLASH Arbitrary File Disclosure Vuln
==================================================================



MLdonkey (up to 2.9.7) has  a  vulnerability  that allows remote user to access any
file   with   rights   of  running  Mldonkey  daemon  by  supplying  a
special-crafted  request  (ok,  there's  not much special about double
slash) to an Mldonkey http GUI (tcp/4080 usually).


Thus, the exploit would be as simple as accessing any file on a remote
host with your browser and double slash:

http://mlhost:4080//etc/passwd
