 
There is a type confusion vulnerability in the SimpleButton constructor. Flash stores an empty button to use to create buttons for optimization reasons. If this object is created using a SWF tag before it is created in the Button class, and it not of type Button, type confusion can occur.
 
A SWF needs to be altered in a hex editor to reproduce this issue. To start, build button.fla. This is a swf with the code:
 
var sb = new SimpleButton();
 
 
When the button is created, the font will be type confused with a button.
