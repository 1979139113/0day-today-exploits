which works since version 1.9.5 from 2014 (current is 1.9.7.1) because
PLA uses &#039;==&#039; instead of &#039;===&#039; for the password comparison in
&#039;attemptGrant&#039; of the &#039;Authorization&#039; class. If the password is set to
one which correspondends to a number in scientific notation, one could
easier bruteforce the password or bypass it completely, e.g.:

php > var_dump(&#039;200&#039; == &#039;2e2&#039;);
bool(true)
php > var_dump(&#039;0&#039; == &#039;0e2&#039;);
bool(true)
php > var_dump(&#039;0&#039; == &#039;0e2342&#039;);
bool(true)

I opened an issue at GitHub for this[0] and have written about it[1]
(section 2 is the interesting one for this issue).

Best,
