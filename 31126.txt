Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Remote Code Execution via PHP unserialize (CVE-2018-14630)
When importing a "drag and drop into text" (ddwtos) question in the legacy
Moodle XML format, the passed feedback answer is used unsanitized in an
unserialize() function, which leads to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability.
By providing a sophisticated PHP Object chain it is possible to leverage the
POI into a fully-blown arbitrary Remote Code Execution (RCE).

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs permissions to create a quiz
or at least be able to import questions. A user of the role teacher usually has
these permissions. However, students can also be assigned to the role teacher for
a specific course.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Remote Code Execution via PHP unserialize (CVE-2018-14630)
In order to exploit this issue an attacker has to open Moodle&#039;s question bank
for a specific course and import the following Moodle XML file. The answer
feedback contains a sophisticated PHP object chain which only contains objects
from Moodles library. After the parsing process the command "echo `whoami`" is
being executed.
