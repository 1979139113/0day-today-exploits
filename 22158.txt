Old solution and sometimes not working method: Go to Catalog -> Downloads and upload file

This trick works by renaming the error log file from error.txt to error.php ( or whatever.php ) and make an wrong sql query in order to log it

1.Go to System -> Settings -> Edit (Your Store) -> Server Tab and at "Error Log Filename" input... put error.php and click save
4.Go to http://www.site.com/system/logs/error.php and there is your php code executed.
