Synopsis
 
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact or exploitability.
 
Known affected software and attack vectors
 
Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
 
An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Java­Script does not appear to be required for an attacker to triggering the vulnerable code path.
