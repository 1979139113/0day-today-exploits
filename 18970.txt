Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities in the PHP Jobsite v1.36 Script.

Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the PHP Recruitment software Jobsite v1.36.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required 
user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerabilities are located in the Login and Change Skin module 
with the bound vulnerable ref & sk parameters.Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing & client-side content 
request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s): 
        [+] Login
        [+] Change Skin

Vulnerable Paramater(s): 
        [+] ref
        [+] sk


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user account & with medium or high
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
