The WordPress plugin &#039;WooCommerce Product Feed&#039; does not correctly sanitize user-input,
which leads to Cross-Site Scripting in the Admin Panel.

Since it is WordPress, it&#039;s fairly easy to get RCE with this XSS, by editing the theme
files via (for example) XHR requests with included Javascript.
