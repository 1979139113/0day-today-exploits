Introduction
==============
 
=============
Front-End
=============   
SQL Injection :
    http://victim.com/albo-folder/?action=visatto&id=[Inject Here]
============
Back-End
============
 
In the back-end, no protection against SQL Injection, XSS and CSRF exists. This are just few examples
 
Blind SQL-Injection
====================
    http://victim.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=responsabili&action=edit&id=[Inject Here]
    http://victim.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=atti&action=view-atto&id=[Inject Here]
 
CSRF
=====
 
In the back-end, the item deletion is not protected, so any element (acts, responsibles, etc.) could be deleted.
 
POC:
 
Responsible deletion 
    http://victim.com/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=responsabili&action=delete-responsabile&id=***responsabile&#039;s id***
Act deletion
    http://victim.com/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=atti&action=annulla-atto&id=***atto&#039;s id***
         
 
Stored XSS
===========
This plugin does not sanitize any output so each form input, except email, is vulnerable to stored XSS.
 
 
Also some Reflected XSS and a possible Shell Uploading vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed.
