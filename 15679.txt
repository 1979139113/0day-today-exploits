            &#039;Description&#039;    => %q{
                    This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53
                prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long &#039;arg&#039; parameter when executing the &#039;jovgraph.exe&#039;
                CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.
 
                This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. It is interesting to
                note that this vulnerability cannot be exploited by overwriting SEH, since attempting
                to would trigger CVE-2010-1964.
 
                The vulnerable code is within a sub-function called from "main" within "ovwebsnmpsrv.exe"
                with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. This function contains a 256 byte stack buffer
                which is passed to the "getProxiedStorageAddress" function within ovutil.dll. When
                processing the address results in an error, the buffer is overflowed in a call to sprintf_new.
                saved return address.
 
                There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why
                at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts
                OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this
                either.
