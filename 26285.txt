arbitrary actions on their behalf. In order to exploit this issue, the
attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into
opening a malicious website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For any page containing a calendar the GET request parameters are appended as hidden inputs when the calendar is configured to have a date switcher. The input isn't properly sanitised and allows an attacker to add attributes to the input, including events.

In order to exploit this issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into opening a malicious website. In addition, the calendar must configured to have a date switcher. By default this is disabled.
Proof of concept

Given the post hello-world, which has a calendar, visit the page with the following URL:

http://<target>/2016/06/22/hello-world/?foo=whoeiii\%22%20accesskey=x%20onclick=alert(1);//

The key combination CTRL + ALT + x triggers the onclick event.
