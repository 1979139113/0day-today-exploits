Vulnerability Details:
======================
The CGI script used in this router does not validate credentials. Hence any page in the router can be directly accessed by replacing page extension with .cgi. Router directly executes for any appropriate HTTP requests. It also disclose credentials (Admin, Support and User logins) in plain test behind page source.

Some direct accessible pages without authentication
========================================
http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi

Searching inside page source will reveal all router login accounts and passwords in plain text

Some other pages:
http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi
http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi
http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi
http://192.168.1.1/setup.cgi


These bypasses authentication and show the corresponding page and any option inside the page can be executed such as reset router, change credentials, backup configuration etc.

Note:
http://192.168.1.1 is the router ip.
