html2ps &#039;include file&#039; Server Side Include Directive Directory Traversal Vulnerability
========================================================================

#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# html2ps <= 1.0 beta5 arbitrary file disclosure
# http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html
# author: epiphant 
#
# the "include file" ssi directive doesn&#039;t check for directory
# traversal so you can include and disclose any file in the
# dir tree (very handy when html2ps is running as a part of a
# web app with data that you control)
# the vuln requires that "ssi" in the @html2ps block in the
# html2psrc file is set to 1, which is the default
#
# bonus info: some of the backtick operators look shady too
#
# shouts: thcx labs, zybadawg333, fabiodds, str0ke
# jan k: shame on you - your perl is very ugly
