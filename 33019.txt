
To reproduce the issue with the files in tapcrash.zip:

1) install frida (pip3 install frida)
2) open sendMessage.py, and replace the sample receiver with the phone number or email of the target device
3) in injectMessage.js replace the marker "FULL PATH" with the path of the obj file
4) in the local directory, run:

python3 sendMessage.py

This will lead to a crash in SpringBoard requiring no user interaction.

I&#039;ve also attached a crash dump and ETencode.m, which is the file that was used to generate the obj file.
