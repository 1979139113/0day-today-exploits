Description :  

A component which allows a Recruitment Agency to advertise vacancies, accept client/employer and candidate registrations, CV submissions, etc.

The component front page provides a Vacancy/Job Search form, top 5 / featured vacancies, job details display and job application. (With CV submission.)

Candidates can apply for vacancies, track interviews, etc.


Partners can view the current vacancies and refer new Clients and Candidates to the agency.

It has been developed in such a way that it can be used in any country. It is Joom!fish 2 compatible too!

A full set of UK Areas (countries and counties), US and Australian states is included and can be installed in seconds. A set of example sectors and rate bands is also included and can also be installed in seconds.

The backend admin allows the administrator to manage clients, vacancies, candidates, applications, interviews, areas, sectors, roles, partners and rate bands. The look and feel of the component can be managed via the CSS Admin page. 

There is also a reports area where CSV and XML files of jobs and candidates can be generated.

There are also modules to show the featured jobs, latest jobs, candidates and clients/employers, and also an area/sector search and candidate search module.
