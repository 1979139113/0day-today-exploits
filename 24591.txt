2. Add a new domain, in &#039;Domain Name&#039; field, add in this(<img src=x onmouseover=alert(1)>) payload.
3. Save, then navigate to main page, hover mouse over &#039;broken image&#039; in &#039;domains&#039; section.
 
Stored XSS in &#039;Mirrors&#039;.
 
[How to?]
1. Open surgeftp web interface, Click on &#039;Mirrors&#039; option from the menu.
2. Click on Add Mirror, in &#039;Local path&#039; & &#039;Remote Host&#039; field add in this(<img src=x onmouseover=alert(1)>) payload.

Previously, Somebody else reported Stored XSS vulnerabilities in SurgeFTP.
which is well not a good practice since i have triggered the same vulnerability by just entering different XSS payload,
therefore White-listing is the correct solution.
