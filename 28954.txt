Details

TorBrowser version 7.0.8, and probably prior,for Mac OS X and Linux, is affected
by a critical security issue. According to the Tor Project, further details will
be released in the near future.

Due to a Firefox bug in handling file:// URLs it is possible on both systems that
users leak their IP address. Once an affected user navigates to a specially crafted
web page, the operating system may directly connect to the remote host,
bypassing Tor Browser.

Users are strongly advised to keep their TorBrowser updated.

We named this vulnerability TorMoil.

Solution

Update TorBrowser to version 7.0.9
