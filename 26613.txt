* System affected  : Akamai NetSession [1].
* Software Version : 1.9.3.1 (other versions may also be affected).
* Impact           : If a low privileged user is infected, a malware is capable 
                     of injecting code into Akamai NetSession process without
                     privilege elevation.


=====[ 2. Detailed description ]================================================

Akamai Netsession 1.9.3.1 is vulnerable to DLL Hijack, it tries to load 
CSUNSAPI.dll without supplying the complete path. The issue is aggravated 
because the mentioned DLL is missing from its installation. Thus making it 
possible to hijack the DLL and subsequently inject code within Akamai 
NetSession process space.
