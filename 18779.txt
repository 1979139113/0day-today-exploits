Title: Lattice Diamond Programmer Buffer Overflow
Advisory ID: CORE-2012-0530
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/lattice-diamond-programmer-buffer-overflow
Date published: 2012-06-21
Date of last update: 2012-06-21
Vendors contacted: Lattice Semiconductor Corporation
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2012-2614


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Lattice Diamond Programmer [1] is vulnerable to client-side attacks,
which can be exploited by remote attackers to run arbitrary code by
sending specially crafted &#039;.xcf&#039; files.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Diamond Programmer 1.4.2 for Windows.
   . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Vendor did not provide this information.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

The vendor did not reply any contact email sent by Core Security
Advisories Team. Contact Lattice for further information about this
issue [2]. Given that this is a client-side vulnerability, affected
users should not open untrusted &#039;.xcf&#039; files using &#039;programmer.exe&#039; nor
&#039;deployment.exe&#039;.


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Daniel Kazimirow and
Ricardo Narvaja from Core Security Exploit Team.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

This vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted
&#039;.xcf&#039; file from &#039;programmer.exe&#039;. The module &#039;deployment.exe&#039; may also
be vulnerable, but this possiblity was not researched any further.

The XML file showed at [Sec. 8.1] crashes &#039;programmer.exe&#039; at the address:

/-----
00FB5E20    8A0402          MOV AL,BYTE PTR DS:[EDX+EAX]
00FB5E23    C2 0400         RETN 4
-----/

 and overwrites the SEH chain (there is no SEH protection) with
&#039;41414141&#039;, which is proof that the buffer was overflown. This means
that there is a buffer overflow vulnerability, and &#039;EIP&#039; can be set to
an arbitrary value, allowing an attacker to take control of the machine.
