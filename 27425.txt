
CVE-2017-6957



In order to allow fast roaming between access points in a wireless network, the Broadcom firmware supports Cisco&#039;s "CCKM Fast and Secure Roaming" feature, allowing a client to roam to a new AP quickly. Note this is a different implementation to IEEE 802.11r-2008 FT.


On the BCM4339 SoC with firmware version 6.37.34.40 the reassociation response in handled by ROM function 0x78D04. This function first retrieves the Cisco-specific IE. Then, it proceeds to check that the IE is valid, by calling function 0x794F8. This function performs four validations:

1. Bytes [2:4] of the IE match Cisco&#039;s OUI (00-40-96)
2. Byte 5 of the IE is zero
3. (IE[20] | (IE[21] << 8)) + 30 == IE[1] + 2 (where IE[1] is the IE&#039;s length field)
4. Bytes [6:9] of the IE match bytes [14:17] of the IE in the reassociation request (see packet capture)

If the IE passes the checks described above, the function proceeds to call ROM function 0x79390. This function unpacks data from the IE, and has approximately the following high-level logic:

1. void function_79390(void* unk, char* ie, char* buf) {
2. char buffer[128];
3. memcpy(buffer, ..., 6); buffer += 6;
4. ...
5. memcpy(buffer, ie + 6, 4); buffer += 4;
6. *buffer = ie[10]; buffer += 1;
7. *buffer = ie[11]; buffer += 1;
8. memcpy(buffer, ie + 12, 8); buffer += 8;
9. memcpy(buffer, ie + 20, 2); buffer += 2;
10. memcpy(buffer, ie + 30, ie[20] | (ie[21] << 8));
11. ...
12. }


(ie[20] | (ie[21] << 8)) + 30 == ie[1] + 2

This means an attacker could craft a reassociation response frame containing a Cisco IE (156) as follows:

1. IE[2:4] = 0x00 0x40 0x96
2. IE[5] = 0
3. IE[20] | (IE[21] << 8) = 227
4. IE[1] = 255
5. IE[6:9] = REQIE[14:17]

This IE satisfies all the constraints validated by function 0x794F8. However, when the IE is the passed into function 0x79390, it will cause memcpy operation at line 10 in the code above to exceed the buffer&#039;s bounds, trigger a stack buffer overflow with attacker controlled data. It should be noted that there is no stack cookie mitigation in the BCM4339 firmware, meaning an attacker would not require an additional vulnerability primitive in order to gain code execution using this vulnerability.


This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. If 90 days elapse
without a broadly available patch, then the bug report will automatically
become visible to the public.
