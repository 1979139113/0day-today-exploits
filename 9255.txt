Â·          Description :
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when handling the â€œSaveAsâ€ function. On saving 
a malicious page with an overly long title (<title> tag in HTML), the program causes a stack-based overflow and makes 
it possible for attackers to execute arbitrary code on usersâ€™ systems.
Â·          How an attacker could exploit the issue :
To exploit the Vulnerability, a hacker might construct a specially crafted Web page, which contains malicious code. 
He then tricks users into visiting his Website and convinces them to save this Page. Right after that, the code would 
be executed, giving him the privilege to make use of the affected system.
