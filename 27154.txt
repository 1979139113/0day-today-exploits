# Date: 27/02/2017
# Exploit Author: Quentin Olagne
# Version: All versions of WiPG-1500 devices up to the latest firmware (1.0.3.7)
# Tested on: Latest firmware (1.0.3.7) of WiPG-1500 device
# CVE : CVE-2017-6351
 
WiPG-1500 device embeds a firmware with a manufacturer account with hard coded username / password. 
Once the device is set in DEBUG mode, an attacker can connect to the device using telnet protocol and log in the device with the &#039;abarco&#039; hard-coded manufacturer account. 
 
This account is not documented, neither the DEBUG feature nor the use of telnetd on a port TCP/5885 (when debug mode is ON).
 
Here&#039;s the extract of the linux &#039;passwd&#039; file:
root:x:0:0:root:/home:/bin/sh
abarco:x:1000:0:Awind-Barco User,,,:/home:/bin/sh
 
and the &#039;shadow&#039;:
root:$1$x1mFoD3w$uuvn.Z0p.XagX29uN3/Oa.:0:0:99999:7:::
abarco:$1$JB0Pn5dA$sROUF.bZVoQSjVrV06fIx1:0:0:99999:7:::
 
This vulnerability has been reported to the vendor but this product (WiPG-1500) is no longer maintained. This means it&#039;s a #WONTFIX vulnerability. Vendor has removed the &#039;abarco&#039; account on the newest models but don&#039;t worry, DEBUG mode is still there with telnetd and you can also use the r00t account with a home and /bin/sh on the other systems in any case.
