================================
A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official MediaCoder v0.8.45 software.
The vulnerability allows local attackers to overwrite the registers to compromise the local software process.

The classic buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the software MediaCoder. An attacker can manipulate the 
bit EIP register in order to execute the next instruction of their choice. Attackers are able to for example 
execute arbitrary codes with process privileges. The attacker includes a large unicode string to overwrite 
the EIP register of the process. Finally the attacker is able to takeover the process by an overwrite of the 
active program process to compromise the computer system.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability 
scoring system) count of 6.0. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privilege or restricted system 
user account without user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in computer system 
manipulation and compromise of the computer system.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Launch MediaCoder.exe                
2. Run the code in perl and a file format (.txt) will create
3. Click File - Add URL
4. open the file (.txt) and copy paste characters http://AAAAAAA ....
5. Made a double click on the link
6. Software will crash with Access violation
7. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability!
