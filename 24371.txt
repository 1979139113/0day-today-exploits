#  CWMP Description:
#  CWMP configuration is accessible only through the 
#  Administrator account. CWMP is a protocol widely 
#  used by ISPs worldwide for remote provisioning 
#  and troubleshooting subscribers&#039; equipment.
#  It includes both a safe auto configuration and the 
#  control of other CPE management functions within 
#  an integrated framework. The protocol addresses 
#  the growing number of different Internet access 
#  devices such as modems, routers, gateways, as well 
#  as end-user devices which connect to the Internet, 
#  such as set-top boxes, and VoIP-phones. The TR-069 
#  standard was developed for automatic configuration 
#  and management of these devices by 
#  Auto  Configuration Servers (ACS).
