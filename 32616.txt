Details

Sierra Wireless is a wireless communications equipement designer and manufacturer. They provide both embedded solutions as well as wireless hardware solutions, including both the ES450 and GX450 devices. The AirLink ES450 is a LTE gateway designed for distributed enterprise. The ES450 is typically seen connecting Point-of-sale devices, remote SCADA equipment, or other business critical equipment. The AirLink ES450 also provides a terminal server for remote out-of-band administration.

ACEManager is the web server included with the AirLink ES450. This web server is responsible for the majority of interactions in the device. Some specific capabilities of the web server are routing, device reconfiguration, user authentication and certificate management. The vendor has stated that the ACEManager web application is not accessible by default from the Cellular WAN.

The default configuration of the device is stored in a location that can be requested without any authentication. The configuration contains all of the details of a factory reset, including, but not limited to, the default password in plain text.

The file is served at /defaults.xml, while on the device it is located at /www/pub/defaults.xml. The following request will attempt to download the default configuration.

 GET /defaults.xml HTTP/1.1
 Host: 192.168.13.31:9191
