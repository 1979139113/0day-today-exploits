Vulnerability Details:

The SySS GmbH found several reflected cross-site scripting 
vulnerabilities in the web application component of the Novell ZENWorks 
Mobile Management solution which can be exploited from different 
attacker&#039;s perspectives.

1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in login form

The parameters "username" and "domain" are not sanitized sufficiently
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

This reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability can be exploited in 
the context of an unauthenticated user by sending a specially crafted
HTTP POST or HTTP GET request (see PoC section).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1.1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in login form using HTTP POST

The following HTTP POST request using the JavaScript code
"onfocus="alert(1) as the value for the parameter "username" demonstrates
the reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability by showing a JavaScript 
alert box:

POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: <HOST>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29

username="onfocus%3d"alert(1)


1.2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in login form using HTTP GET

The following HTTP GET requests using the JavaScript code
"onfocus="alert(1) as the value for the URL parameter "username"
demonstrate the two reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
by showing a JavaScript alert box.

URL: https://<HOST>/index.php?username="onfocus="alert(1)
