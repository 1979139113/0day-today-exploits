
Any logged in user can move pages, regardless of their permission level.

Proof of concept

    Create a blank WordPress site, activate CMS Tree Page View plugin, and log in as admin
    Publish a new page, to accompany the “Sample page” WordPress creates by default
    Note the order of the two pages in the “Pages Tree” panel on the admin dashboard, and their corresponding IDs. In our example, page with ID 4 is at the top of the tree, followed by page with ID 2.
    Log out, and log back in as a subscriber, with standard subscriber permissions (i.e. no edit capabilities)
    Visit /wp-admin/
    In the console, run:

    jQuery.post(ajaxurl, {
      action: "cms_tpv_move_page",
      "node_id": 4,
      "ref_node_id": 2,
      "type": ‘after’,
        "icl_post_language": &#039;en&#039;
      }, function(data, textStatus) {
    });

    Log out, and log back in as admin. The “Pages Tree” panel should now show page with ID 2 at the top, with page ID 4 second (i.e. the reverse of before).

Mitigation/further actions

Upgrade to version 1.4.
