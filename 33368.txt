# Software Link: https://www.arformsplugin.com/documentation/changelog/
# Version: 3.7.1
# CVE ID: CVE-2019-16902

#**************Start Notes**************
# Pay attention to the 3 numbers at the beginning maybe you need to change it in other types like in this script is 143.
# But maybe in other forms maybe it&#039;s different so you have to change it accordingly.
# This version of the software is applicable to path traversal attack so you can delete files if you knew the path such ../../ and so on 
# There is a request file with this Script make sure to put it in the same folder.
