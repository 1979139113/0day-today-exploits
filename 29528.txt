Details

With the ability to download files from remote computers we gain the ability to download files from the server. The downloading files from remote computer is implemented by being able to download files from a folder on the remote computer. This makes a directory on the server that is synced with the remote computer and an admin can download from this directory. By using directory traversal with this functionality we can download any file from the server.


Examples of files that can be of interest for an attacker:
-   The binary of the website (can be decompiled to source code using dotPeek):

-   ASP-webpages and their sources:

-   Unattended Windows installation log:
