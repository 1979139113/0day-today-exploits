Seo Panel 2.1.0 - Critical File Disclosure
==========================================

-:: The Advisory ::-
Seo Panel is prone to Critical File Disclosure due to download.php does not sanitize user-
input properly via the "file" GET-parameter.
By using ....// instead of ../ to traverse through directories and by appending a %00 byte
in the end of the request it is possible to load virtually any file that the webserver user has
read access to. The PHP function which reads & returns the data from the file is: readfile($var);
 
 
Proof of Concept URL:
http://example.tld/seopanel/download.php?filesec=sitemap&filetype=text&file=....//config/sp-config.php%00.txt
 
Note: This attack requires a valid user though it works regardless of any privileges the user might have.
(User registrations are enabled by default as well, making this attack possible in most scenarios.)
 
 
-:: Solution ::-
download.ctrl.php: (Line 55-62)
55  function isValidFile($fileName) {
56      $fileName = urldecode($fileName);
57      $fileName = str_replace(&#039;../&#039;, &#039;&#039;, $fileName);
59          return $fileName;
60      }      
61      return false;
62  }
     
Suggested patch: (Line 55-62)
55  function isValidFile($fileName) {
56      $fileName = urldecode($fileName);
        // This isn&#039;t as easy to bypass anymore
57      $fileName = str_replace(&#039;..&#039;, &#039;&#039;, $fileName); // This is changed.
59          return $fileName;
60      }      
61      return false;
62  }
