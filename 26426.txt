#  Description:
#  The ntpd program is an operating-system daemon that sets and maintains 
#  a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard 
#  time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol 
#  (NTP) version 4, but retains compatibility with versions 1, 2, and 3.
#  ntpd uses a single configuration-file to run the daemon in server and/or 
#  client modes. The configuration file, usually named ntp.conf, is located 
#  in the /etc directory. Other important files include the drift file, which 
#  ntpd uses to correct for hardware-clock skew in the absence of a connection 
#  to a more accurate upstream time-server.
#
#  Nonce is an arbitrary number that may only be used once. It is similar in 
#  spirit to a nonce word, hence the name. It is often a random or pseudo-random 
#  number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications 
#  cannot be reused in replay attacks. They can also be useful as initialization
#  vectors and in cryptographic hash function. A nonce is an arbitrary number used
#  only once in a cryptographic communication, in the spirit of a nonce word. 
#  They are often random or pseudo-random numbers. Many nonces also include a 
#  timestamp to ensure exact timeliness, though this requires clock synchronization 
#  between organizations. The addition of a client nonce ("cnonce") helps to improve 
#  the security in some ways as implemented in digest access authentication. To ensure 
#  that a nonce is used only once, it should be time-variant (including a suitably
#  fine-grained timestamp in its value), or generated with enough random bits to ensure
#  nonce.
