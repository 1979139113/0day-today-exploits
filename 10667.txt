Public Media Manager SQLi vulns 
================================

Product name: Public Media Manager
 
This product, an online NEWS CMS, suffers from SQL injection in login so that we can bypass the login system.
Also, it suffers from SQLi in the GET variables which can be exploited to get different information from the database.

Maybe there are more vulns but I can't give more time in auditing codes.
