Software: https://shop.gopro.com/softwareandapp/gopro-fusion-studio-app/fusion-studio.html
Affected version: 1.2.1.400

Summary: Go Pro Fusion Studio is a feature rich editing software that
allows you to transform your content into pro-quality videos.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'GoProFusionDeviceDetectionService' for Windows deployed as part
of GoPro Fusion Studio App solution. This could potentially allow an authorized
but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges
on the system. A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to
insert their code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security
applications where it could potentially be executed during application startup
or reboot. If successful, the local useras code would execute with the elevated
privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 10 Professional
