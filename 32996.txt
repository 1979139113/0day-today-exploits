~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

FANUC Robotics Virtual Robot Controller is an application for
programming simulated industry robots.

Due to an insufficient validation of user input, the HTTP service of
the application is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

vrimserve.exe offers an HTTP service on TCP port 8090, which can be used
to control virtual robots and view their log files.

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the log viewer
functionality.

By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web server, files and
directories that match the pattern "*.*" can be listed anywhere on the
filesystem. Furthermore, the contents of files named "logfile.txt" can
be read.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

The string "..%5C" can be used to access the parent directory.

Therefore, by accessing a URL similar to the following, it is possible
to obtain a list of files (and directories with a . in their name) in
the root directory of the C:\ partition (or another partition, depending
on the software installation).

http://${target_host}:8090/namedrobots/folder/dir/..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C../

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

The vendor has not yet released a security update.

It is recommended not making the remote admin web server (vrimserve.exe)
available to untrusted networks.
