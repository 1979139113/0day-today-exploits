|Description| 
+-----------+ 

Kaseya 6.3 suffers from an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability that can be leveraged to gain remote code 
execution on the Kaseya server. The code executed in this way will run with a local IUSR account’s privileges. 
Directory traversal is not necessary to gain code execution however, as the default path lies within the 
application’s web-root.
