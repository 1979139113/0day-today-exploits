| Microcart 1.0 Checkout Cross-Site Scripting Security Vulnerability |
\-------------------------------------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

Microcart 1.0 is subject to several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Multiple POST parameters on the /checkout.php page were found to be subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. It was possible to inject arbitrary Javascript into a POST request. This code is then passed into the page content without sanitisation, and executed by the browser. The following parameters are affected:  first_name, last_name, cc, exp, cvv, address1, address2, city, state, zip, phone and email. Injecting the following Javascript code into any of the affected parameters on the /checkout.php page will trigger the vulnerability, causing the page to return a Javascript alert box.
