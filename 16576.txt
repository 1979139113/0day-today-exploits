Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
ServiceDesk Plus version 8.0 Build 8013 is prone to multiple persistent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities as the user-supplied input received via certain  parameters is not properly sanitized.
 
This can be exploited by submitting specially crafted input to the affected software.  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the user's browser session in the security context of the targeted site. The attacker could gain access to user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the targeted site, access recently submitted data by the target user via web forms, or take actions on the site masquerading as the target user.
