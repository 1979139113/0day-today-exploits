Dell Sonicwall Scrutinizer suffers from several SQL injections, many of which can end up with
remote code execution. An attacker needs to be authenticated, but not as an administrator.
However, that wouldn’t stop anyone since there is also a privilege escalation vulnerability in that
any authenticated user can change any other user’s password, including the admin. One SQL
injection, which a Metasploit module was provided for, requires this privilege escalation to reach
since it exists in the new user mechanism only available to admins.
 
Privilege escalation via password change mechanism
———————————————————-
When changing you password, you POST a request with a savePrefs variable. This variable is
actually the id of the user whose password is being changed. By changing it to ‘1’, for instance,
you will change the password for the person with an ID of 1 (which is always admin as far as I
can tell).
 
 
SQL injection in new user mechanism (requires admin)
————————————————————-
When creating a new user, the selectedUserGroup variable POSTed to /cgi-bin/admin.cgi is
vulnerable to SQL injection that allows an attacker to read an arbitrary ﬁle from the FS.
 
A Metasploit module was provided that exploits the above two vulnerabilities to escalate an
arbitrary authenticated user to admin, which then will read /etc/passwd via the SQL injection.
See auxiliary module scrutinizer_password_change.rb.

Within the appliance, you may see /home/plixer/scrutinizer/html/d4d/exporters.php. This script,
which is used actively throughout the web UI, is riddled with SQL injections. You can read the
ﬁle and see the way the programmer(s?) is building their SQL injections. I will detail some of the
injections that I could exploit and achieve RCE with (with Metasploit modules).
 
The changeUnit function is vulnerable to a UNION-based SQL injection in the user_id parameter
which allows a remote user to write a ﬁle to the ﬁlesystem via the OUTFILE vector. We have
write permissions on the folder from the sql injection, so a PHP script can be written to /home/
plixer/scrutinizer/html/d4d/ and the code will be executed upon a GET. A metasploit module was
provided for this. (see scrutinizer_changeunit_sqli_exec.rb)

The methodDetail function is vulnerable to a UNION-based SQL injection similar to the one
above. The methodDetail parameter itself is what is vulnerable. A metasploit module that
achieves RCE via this vector has been supplied. ( see scrutinizer_methoddetail_sqli_exec.rb)
