Vulnerable SUSE/Portus 2.2 - https://github.com/SUSE/Portus

Portus 2.2 is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it
fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the
browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This
may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and
to launch other attacks.

To exploit this issue following steps:

1- Create a Team like "<script>alert(1)</script>" for example.
2- Click into "Create new namespace" link and search into "Team" field
something like this "<script".
