Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered two XSS vulnerabilities in Easing Slider WordPress plugin, which can be exploited against administrators of WordPress (with the vulnerable plugin) to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to steal administratorâ€™s cookies and gain complete control over the website.

1) Two Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities in Easing Slider WordPress Plugin: CVE-2015-1436

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input data passed via the "edit" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script when "page" is set to "easingslider_manage_customizations". A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. 

PoC code below uses JS "alert()" function to display "ImmuniWeb" popup:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=easingslider_manage_customizations&edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/ImmuniWeb/%29;%3C/script%3E

1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input data passed via the "edit" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin.php" script when "page" is set to "easingslider_edit_sliders". A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. 

PoC code below uses JS "alert()" function to display "ImmuniWeb" popup:

http://[host]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=easingslider_edit_sliders&edit=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/ImmuniWeb/%29;%3C/script%3E
