Affected version: 4.7.1 (Revision 25172)

Summary: Reliance is a professional SCADA/HMI system designed for the
visualization and control of industrial processes and for building automation.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting the
service &#039;RelianceOpcDaWrapper&#039; for Windows deployed as part of Reliance 4 SCADA/HMI
system installer including Reliance OPC Server. This could potentially allow an
authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the local user to be
able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other
security applications where it could potentially be executed during application
startup or reboot. If successful, the local userâ€™s code would execute with the
elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)
           Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
