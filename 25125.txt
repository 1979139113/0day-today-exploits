Radiant is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed for small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is a general purpose content management system (not just a blogging engine) written in Ruby.
 
Stored XSS 1 – File Title Upload
 
The attacker must first be a user of sorts, as there's only 2 types of roles 'administrator' & 'designer' we're going with the assumption of the latter. Now as the designer we have the option to upload 'assets' such as files or images, here lyes one of the issues.
 
 
Enter the example below.
 
POC:
 
Title: </script>alert('XSS')</script>
 
 
Stored XSS 2 – User Personal Preferences
 
This time round were faced with a lot more avenues to have our JS displayed back to us. Again, we're going with the assumption that we're logged in as a designer user.
 
Let us navigate to the 'Settings page', where you'll see  2 options to edit Personal Preferences & Configuration, click on Edit Prefrences.
 
POC:
 
Name: <script>alert('XSS 1')</script>
Email Address: <script>alert('XSS2')</script>@gmail.com
Username: <script>alert('XSS3')</script>
