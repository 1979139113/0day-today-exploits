Business recommendation:
------------------------
Comala Workflows suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input
and output validation. By exploiting these vulnerabilities an attacker could:
    1. Attack other users of the web application with JavaScript code,
       browser exploits or Trojan horses, or
    2. perform unauthorized actions in the name of another logged-in user.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Multiple cross-site scripting issues
Comala Workflows suffers from multiple reflective & stored cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to steal other user&#039;s
sessions, to impersonate other users and to gain unauthorized access to
documents hosted in the Confluence instance where the Workflows module is
embedded.
There are many parameters which are not properly sanitized and thus are
vulnerable to XSS.

2. Cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities
Comala Workflows does not implement the use of shared secrets (tokens)
If an attacker is able to lure a user into clicking a crafted link or
by embedding such a link within web pages (e.g. discussion forums) he
could manipulate data or automatically inject XSS payloads to attack
other users.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Multiple cross-site scripting issues
a) The input parameters for giving a workflow a name, appending a label to a
given workflow, or adding a new task for a given state are not properly
sanitized and thus susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting. The hereby
affected scripts alongside the vulnerable GET parameters are:
   Script                       GET Parameter(s)
   saveproperties.action        newLabelName, newWorkflowName
   newtask.action               taskName

When editing an existing workflow via the Markup functionality (accessible via
the workflowMarkup POST parameter of
/plugins/approvalsworkflow/saveworkflowmarkup.action) the attachment-macro is
also susceptible to reflected cross-site scripting.

b) When editing an existing workflow via the Markup functionality (accessible
via the workflowMarkup POST parameter of
/plugins/approvalsworkflow/saveworkflowmarkup.action) the workflow element
task does not sanitize the given input and is thus susceptible to
cross-site scripting. The application does not sanitize the given input before
printing it to the "Page Activity" popup which leads to the execution of the
permanently injected script. When assigning such a task to a co-worker, an
e-mail containing the actual payload is sent to the assigned person and when
opening the "My Comala Workflow Tasks", "Page Activity", or
"Page Activity Macro" page, it gets executed.

2. Cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities
The /plugins/approvalsworkflow/saveworkflowmarkup.action script for editing
an existing workflow via the Markup functionality, for example, is susceptible
to cross-site request forgery. If an attacker knows a valid project name
(key parameter) and the corresponding workflow name (workflowName parameter),
she might exploit this vulnerability to set the Markup code of the workflow
to an arbitrary value (e.g. a XSS payload via the task element, see 1. b)).


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in up to and including
version 4.6.1.
