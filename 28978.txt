#Version : 0.9.9 - Beta 
#Tested on: Kali
#Description: 
Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous
IP space and hostnames against specified domains.  It&#039;s really meant
of those require that you already know what IP space you are looking
for.  This does not perform exploitation and does not scan the whole
internet indiscriminately.  It is meant specifically to locate likely
targets both inside and outside a corporate network.  Because it uses
DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks that leak
internal address space. That&#039;s especially useful in targeted malware.
