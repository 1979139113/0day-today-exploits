Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local command inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official PhotoSync 1.1.3 Android mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own commands by usage of stored manipulated system/device values to 
compromise the android mobile web-application.

The command inject vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `albumname` value of the `uploadImageAlbumSelect` module. 
Local attackers are able to inject own malicious system specific commands or local path value to requests by usage of 
the vulnerable `albumname` value. The execution of the command occurs in the `listAlbum` module of the mobile application. 
Attackers are able to manipulate the local default photo app albumname values to provoke with a client-side GET method 
request the command injection. The attack vector is located on the application-side and the injection requires physical 
device access or a local low privileged device user account. Local attackers are also able to exploit the albumname 
validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes.

The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability 
scoring system) count of 5.2. Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a low privileged android device 
account with restricted access and no user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized 
execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to compromise the mobile iOS application and the 
connected device components.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local command inject web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers (network) without privileged application user account or user interaction.
