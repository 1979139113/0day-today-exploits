#
# Xchat <= 2.8.7b Remote Code Execution (tested on Windows XP SP1+SP2+SP3, IE6 & IE7 fully patched)
# Vendor : http://xchat.org/
# Affected Os : Windows *
# Risk : critical
#
# This bug is related to the URI Handler vulnerability but the approch is a bit different.
# We don&#039;t use any % or  ../../../ as the others related bugs, just a single "
# According to the registry , when the IRCS:// URI is called , the command launched is :
# C:\Program Files\xchat\xchat.exe --existing --url="%1"
#
# The xchat --help option tells us :
# " --command=COMMAND :Send a command to existing xchat "
#
# So we add a simple " at the end of the URL and we&#039;re in business ?
# Yep =) ircs://blabla@3.3.3.3" --command "shell calc"
#
# Note: The victim needs to be connected to an irc server , and also need IE * .
