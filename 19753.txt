
Introduction:
=============
idev-Rentals is a PHP Script (special software for your website) allows you to create an apartment / housing / accommodation
rentals listing directory. You and your website visitors can add property rentals, upload photos, add property location
information that will display visually on a Google Map embedded plugin. You can choose to charge for listings, or make your
rentals directory entire free for visitors to post their rental listings to. idev-Rentals allows you to service either a broad
or highly targeted region. You can create a worldwide rentals directory or a rentals directory limited to a specific city or region.
 
You can customize the appearance entirely, add your own graphics, logo, colors, header/footer, and fully integrate idev-Rentals
in to your website! More theme style templates are available from our demo page. When you purchase idev-Rentals, we will deliver
(electronically) to you the files that you will then need to upload to your website in order to run idev-Rentals There is a simple
installation process (that we fully support) (and we also offer a complete installation service, if you need that kind of help) the
entire process can completed in as little as 5 minutes.
 
You will have full access to an administrative control panel area where you will be able to manage all idev-Rentals functions easily
and without any technical knowledge. All of our website software (PHP Scripts) are designed to be customized fully. We include a good
You will have the option to create your own theme style templates (feel free to share them with the community!) and if you are a
programmer/advanced developer, you will also have full access to our source code, which means that you can literally change anything or
add any features that you might need. Create an Open Rentals Directory Website As a business startup idea, you could be the first in your
area to offer a rentals listings website which is open to visitors to submit their own rental listings. This can be a wonderful money
earning business startup idea since you could then place advertising, or charge for listings on your website.

Severity:
=========
Medium
 
 
Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in idev-Rentals 1.0 php rental script.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the add listing, add category and add package module with the
bound vulnerable Title, Caption Description, Location, Category name, package Name and Package Description parameters.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged web application user account.
 
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] Add Listing
            [+] Add Category
            [+] Add Package
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] [Title][Caption][Description] [Location]
            [+] [Category name]
            [+] [Package Name] - [Package Description]
 
 
Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium privileged application user account
and with low or medium required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
1.2.1
The remote attacker can add standard listing to inject own malicious persistent script code,
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the fields Title, Caption, Description, Location
When a admin is processing to view the users listing, the malicious script code will be executed.
 
URL: http://idevnetwork.127.0.0.1:1336/[PATH]/idev-rentals/index.php?page=account_add
 
1.2.2
The remote attacker can add category to inject own malicious persistent script code,
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the fields category name.
When a user is processing to view the category listing, the malicious script code will be executed.
 
URL: http://idevnetwork.127.0.0.1:1336/[PATH]/idev-rentals/admin/index.php?page=categories
 
1.3
The remote attacker can add packages to inject own malicious persistent script code,
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the fields package name or package description
When a user is processing to view the packages listing, the malicious script code will be executed.
 
URL: http://idevnetwork.127.0.0.1:1336/[PATH]/idev-rentals/admin/index.php?page=add_package
 
 
Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
