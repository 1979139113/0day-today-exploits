1. Description:
When editing a thread the user is given to the option to convert the thread to a link.
 

2. Proof of Concept:

Persistent XSS
- Edit a thread or post you&#039;ve made
- At the bottom of the edit page in the Thread Link box input the following <a """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
- Now visit the forum your thread/post exists in to see the alert.


3. Solution:
The plugin has since been removed after notifying the author.

Patch in line 83:
$thread[&#039;tlink&#039;] = ($thread[&#039;tlink&#039;]);

to

$thread[&#039;tlink&#039;] = htmlspecialchars_uni($thread[&#039;tlink&#039;]);
