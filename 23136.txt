Technical Details & Description:
================================
A sql injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official PHPLIST v3.0.6 & v3.0.10 open source web-application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject sql commands by usage of a vulnerable value to compromise the application dbms.

The sql injection vulnerability is located in the abo user search engine of the phplist application. Local privileged accounts 
are able to inject own sql commands by usage of vulnerable findby value in the abo user search module. A successful attack requires 
to manipulate a GET method request with vulnerable findby value. The injection is a basic order by sql injection that allows to 
compromise the web-application.

The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.1.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability result in web-application and database management system compromise.
