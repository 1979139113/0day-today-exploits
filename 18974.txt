Issue Summary

Description of Vulnerability:

Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS) written in PHP and MySQL.
The Drupal Book Block module (https://drupal.org/project/bookblock) allows users to create a
block on their page that can generate an individual menu block for each of a site&#039;s books.
These blocks can then be administered as any other block to appear on the pages you choose.
The Book Block module contains a persistent script injection vulnerability (XSS) on its admin
page that fails to properly sanitize the titles of books.
Systems Affected:

Drupal 6.26 with Book Block 6.x-1.0-beta1 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.

Impact:

Users who have the ability to create books on the website can inject arbitrary script into
book titles. This script will execute whenever a user navigates to /admin/content/book/blocks.
This could lead to privilege escalation, account compromise or other attacks. This exploit
affects

Mitigating Factors:

In order to insert a malicious script into the database, access to a valid user account with
the ability to create Book nodes is required.

Proof of Concept:

1. Install and enable the Book Block module
2. Navigate to /node/add and click "Book page" to create a new book page
4. Navigate to /admin/content/book/blocks to view the rendered JavaScript
