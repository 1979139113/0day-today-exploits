Advisory Details:
 
High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Ilch CMS, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against users and administrators of vulnerable application.
 
1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Ilch CMS: CVE-2014-1944
 
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "text" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/index.php/guestbook/index/newentry" URL. A remote unauthenticated user can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request, which allows to permanently inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user√¢??s browser in context of the vulnerable website when the victim visits the "http://[host]/index.php/guestbook/index/index" URL.
 
The exploitation example below uses the JavaScript "alert()" function to display "immuniweb" word:
 
POST /index.php/guestbook/index/newentry HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 151
