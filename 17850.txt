#[0x1] - About

 Boomerank is a CMS which can also be used for webstore because it is highly modular by design. 
It is also compatible or specially designed for use with DataLab Pantheon Information System.
 
#[0x2] - Vulnerability

I have identified 3 SQLi vulnerabilities. 2 are inconclusive since they don't affect every setup or project in same manner.
In some cases the variable is sanitized in some not!
Therefore I will not go into details with those particular vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability 1:

WebShop module has a function that allows adding item to shopping cart.(icon "V voziƒçek")
