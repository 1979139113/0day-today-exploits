Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in webEdition, which can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the target system.


1) Path Traversal in webEdition: CVE-2014-5258

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the "file" HTTP GET parameter in "/webEdition/showTempFile.php" script. A remote authenticated user can send a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing directory traversal sequences (e.g. "../") and read contents of arbitrary files on the target system with privileges of the web server.

The exploitation example below display contents of "/etc/passwd" file:

http://[host]/webEdition/showTempFile.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires valid user credentials. Registration is not open by default and all user accounts are created by the administrator of the web application.
