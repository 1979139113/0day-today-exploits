Vulnerable: BBSMAX 4.2 BBSMAX 4.1 BBSMAX 3.0

For example:

/liscker/)</script>

BBSMAX Home Page : http://www.bbsmax.com/

BBSMAX is prone to an cross-site scripting vulnerability because the
application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied
input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code
in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the
context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal
cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other
attacks.

The three versions of BBSMAX is vulnerable; other versions may also be
affected.
