CVE-2018-12589
 
 
Security Issue:
================
Polaris Office 2017 8.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse "puiframeworkproresenu.dll" file
in the current working directory, due to a search order flaw vulnerability.
 
1) create a 32bit DLL named "puiframeworkproresenu.dll"
2) put any .PDF or .PPTX file or whatever that is configured to open in Polaris Office in same directory as the above DLL 
3) open the document (PDF etc) then BOOM our arbitrary DLL will execute on victims system.
 
This can be observed as well with both the DLL and a document opened from a remote share.
