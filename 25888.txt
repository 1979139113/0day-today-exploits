 
The ActionScript parameter conversion in the fix for an issue in the December Flash bulletin (https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-32.html, most likely one of the UaFs reported by Yuki Chen) can sometimes access a parameter on the native stack that is uninitialized.
 
If:
 
var o = {};
o.unwatch();
 
 
A PoC is attached, it is a bit finicky but crashes in the most recent Chrome Flash update. To reproduce, load crasher2.swf?num=15, and then immediately loading crasher2.swf?num=4. The num parameter shifts the stack (for nums between 0 and 31), so changing it around should lead to crashes in different browsers.
