Summary and Impact
==================
A type confusion has been identified in the Thunderbird email
forked from upstream libical version 0.47.
The issue can be triggered remotely, when an attacker sends an specially
crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It
might be used by a remote attacker to crash the process or leak
information from the client system via calendar replies.
X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software.

Product Description
===================
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and
calendaring client, that's easy to set up and customize.

Analysis
========
A type confusion in icalproperty.c
icaltimezone_get_vtimezone_properties() can be triggered while parsing a
malformed calendar attachment. Missing sanity checks allows a TZID
property to be parsed as ICALFLOATVALUE but it is later used as a
string.
The bug manifests with strdup(tzid); being called with tzid containing
a bad pointer obtained by casting to char* from a float value, which
typically means segfaulting by dereferencing a non-mapped memory page.
An attacker might be able to deliver an input file containing specially
crafted float values as TZID properties which could point to arbitrary
memory positions.
Certain conditions could allow to exfiltrate information via a calendar
reply or other undetermined impact.

Workarounds
===========
A fix is available from upstream. Alternatively, libical can be replaced
by icaljs, a JavaScript implementation of ical parsing, by setting
calendar.icaljs = true in Thunderbird configuration.
