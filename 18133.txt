Organizer for WordPress. This is the second in series of advisories 
concerning vulnerabilities in this plugin.

These are Cross-Site Scripting (reflected and persistent), Cross-Site 
Request Forgery and Arbitrary File Upload (Code Execution) vulnerabilities.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------


As answered me the developer of the plugin, he doesn't support it anymore 
and will not be fixing any vulnerabilities in it.

----------
Details:
----------

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php&edit_id=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

XSS (Persistent) (WASC-08):

Exploit:

http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2012/Organizer%20XSS-2.html

Code will execute at the page users.php of the plugin.

CSRF (WASC-09):

Via attack on function Add/Edit User Setting (which combined into the same 
POST request) it's possible to add and edit settings.

POST request at page 
http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php. Similarly to 
above exploit for XSS.

Via attack on function Delete User Setting it's possible to delete settings.

http://site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=organizer/page/users.php&delete_id=admin

Arbitrary File Upload (Code Execution) (WASC-31):

It's possible to upload arbitrary files with code execution (php files). 
Because in field "File extensions allowed" it's possible to set extensions 
of scripts, such as "php".

This will allow to upload to the server and execute arbitrary scripts. 
Besides attacking admin via above-mentioned CSRF vulnerability for changing 
of the settings (or getting access to admin account for this), the 
Insufficient Authorization vulnerability (described in the third advisory) 
rights as Subscriber).
