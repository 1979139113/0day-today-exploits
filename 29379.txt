Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The vulnerability laboratory core research team discovered multiple sql-injection vulnerabilities in the official Icyphoenix v2.2.0.105 content management system.


Affected Product(s):
====================
Icyphoenix
Product: Phpbb Forum Engine - Content Management System 2.2.0.105


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple sql injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Icyphoenix v2.2.0.105 content management system.
The web vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute own malicious sql commands to compromise the web-application or dbms. 

The sql injection web vulnerabilities are located in the `unaprove` and `order` parameters of the `admin_jr_admin.php`, 
`functions_kb.php` or `admin_kb_art.php` files. Remote attackers with privileged web-application user accounts are able to 
execute own sql commands by usage of an insecure GET method request with the vulnerable parameters of the web-application. 
The attack vector of the vulnerability is located on the application-side and the request method to inject is GET. The security 
vulnerability in the content management system is a classic select remote sql-injection vulnerability.

The security risk of the vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 5.0.
Exploitation of the remote sql injection vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the remote sql injection results in database management system, web-server or web-application compromise.

Request Method(s): 
[+] GET
                       
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] ./adm/

Vulnerable File(s):
[+] admin_jr_admin.php
[+] admin_kb_art.php
[+] functions_kb.php

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The sql.injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged web-application user account and without user interaction.
