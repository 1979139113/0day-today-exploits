# Category: Webapps
# Exploit Author: Giulio Comi
# CVE : CVE-2018-6180
 
 
#Description
 
A flaw in the profile section of Online Voting System allows an unauthenticated user to set an arbitrary password for accounts registered in the application.
 
The application does not check the validity of the session cookie and updates the password and other fields of a user based on an incremental identifier and without requiring the current valid password for target account.
