Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in EMC M&R (Watch4net)
Web Portal. This issue allows attackers to replace the report that is
shown at startup, the attackers payload will be stored in the user&#039;s
profile and will be executed  every time the victim logs in. The
attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as
stealing victims&#039; session tokens or login credentials, performing
arbitrary actions on their behalf, logging their keystrokes, or exploit
issues in other areas of Watch4net.

This vulnerability exists due to the fact that the description_0 POST parameter is not properly encoded when rendering the selected report. In order to exploit this issue, an attacker must trick a victim into opening a specially crafted web page, for example by send the link via email, posting the link on a (trusted) website or through other means.

This issue allows attackers to replace the report that is shown at startup, the attackers payload will be stored in the user&#039;s profile and will be executed every time the victim logs in. The attacker-supplied code can perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing victims&#039; session tokens or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on their behalf, logging their keystrokes, or exploit issues in other areas of Watch4net.

The following proof of concept demonstrates this issue. It will use JavaScript to send the session cookie(s) to an attacker controlled website.
