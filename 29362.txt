environment.


Description:

It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in FreeMarker templates through
Struts FreeMarker tags to occur. An attacker who has restricted administration
rights to Bamboo or who hosts a website that a Bamboo administrator visits, is
able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on
systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo.

Bamboo when there is at least one linked Mercurial repository that the attacker
has permission to use, or commit to a Mercurial repository used by a Bamboo plan
which has branch detection enabled can execute code of their choice on systems
that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo Server.
