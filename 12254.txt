Application: File Thingie
Version: 2.5.5

Description:
users from uploading PHP files and also renaming them to PHP extensions. However
a text file containing PHP code. An attacker can exploit a weakness in the file
rename process allowing the attacker to rename a text file (containing code) to a
.php extension and execute the script.
 
This exploit demonstrates a way to backdoor File Thingie by uploading an *.inc file
that contains a backdoored copy of File Thingie, then uploading a *.txt file
containing some PHP code that will overwrite ft2.php to execute the backdoored
copy of File Thingie. But first the *.txt file has to be renamed to a *.php
and then executed in the browser.
 
Test Environment:
* Tested on WAMP Server 2.0
* WAMP running on Windows XP, SP2 (EN)
