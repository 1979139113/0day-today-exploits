Affected Product(s):
====================
WK EDV GmbH
Product: WK UDID - iOS Mobile Web Application 1.0.1
 
 
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local
 
 
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
 
 
Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local command inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official WK UDID v1.0.1 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows to inject malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable mobile app.
 
The vulnerability is located in the device name value of the send by mail function. Local attackers are able to manipulate the name value 
of the device to compromise the mail function of the wkudid mobile app. The html encoding is broken in the send by mail export function. 
Local attackers are able to manipulate the device name id to compromise the application internal validation in send emails. The attack vector 
of the vulnerability is server-side and the injection point is the device name information settings.
 
The security risk of the local commandpath inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 5.6. 
Exploitation of the commandpath inject vulnerability requires a low privilege androidios device account with restricted access and no user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to 
compromise the mobile iOS application and connected device components.
