Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in the CLscript v3.0 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to inject/execute own sql commands on the affected
application dbms. The vulnerabilities are located in the userDetail.php, advertise_detail.php or
land.php files with the bound vulnerable pid, rid and id parameters. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in dbms, service & application compromise.
 
Vulnerable File(s):
                [+] userDetail.php
                [+] advertise_detail.php
                [+] land.php
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] land
                [+] pageDetail
                [+] enquiry_detail
                [+] userDetail
                [+] advertise_detail
                [+] config_id
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] rID
                [+] ID
                [+] pID
                [+] faq_id
                [+] sp_id
                [+] config_id
 
1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the CLscript v3.0 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The input validation vulnerabilities are located in the topic, new word, subcategories, add a new help, add currency
or add new FAQs modules. Remote attackers can inject script code to the vulnerable modules by injecting malicious
tags as titles, descriptions, word names, category names, currency code or as questions. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.
Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account.
 
Vulnerable Module(s):
                [+] Topic
                [+] New word
                [+] Subcategory
                [+] Add a new help
                [+] Add currency (Symbol - Currency code)
                [+] Add new FAQ (Question)
 
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                [+] (title - description)
                [+] (word name)
                [+] (category name)
                [+] (name)
                [+] (symbol - currency code)
                [+] (question)
 
 
Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged user accounts or user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with local low privileged user accounts and
with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...
 
PoC:
 
1) http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=manage_forum
create topic  (title - description is injectable)
 
2)
http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=manage_spam_words -
add a new word (word is injectable)
 
3)
http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=catalog&parentId=608 -
add subcategory (category name is injectable)
 
4)
http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=manage_help -
add a new help
 
5)
http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=manage_currencie
Add currency (Symbol - Currency code is injectable)
 
6)
http://n1.127.0.0.1:1338/[INTERFACE]/land.php?file=manage_faq
add new FAQ (Question is injectable)
 
 
Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as critical.
 
1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
