1. Description

Sagemcom F@st 5260 routers on firmware version 0.4.39 (and possibly
others), in WPA mode, default to using a PSK that is generated from a
2-part wordlist of known values and a nonce with insufficient entropy. The
number of possible PSKs is about 1.78 billion, which is too small.

2. Wordlist / PoC

A txt file has been created that contains every possible default PSK. It

3. Mitigation

Change the default PSK key to a more secure key with greater entropy.
