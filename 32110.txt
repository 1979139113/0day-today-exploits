CVE:                    CVE-2018-19934
Security researcher:    Chris Moberly @ The Missing Link Security
Product name:           Serv-U FTP Server
Product version:        Tested on 15.1.6.25 (current as of Dec 2018)
Fixed in:               Serv-U 15.1.6 hotfix 3

# Overview
The Serv-U FTP Server is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting
attack at the following injection points:

**Injection Point: URL Path**
* /Admin/XML
* /Admin/XML/Result.xml

As a proof of concept, browsing to the URLs below while authenticated as a
member of one of the administrative groups will produce a harmless JavaScript
alert box.

* /Admin/XML/Result.xml%22%3balert(&#039;XSS!&#039;)//xxx?Command=DismissWhatsNew
* /Admin/XML%22%3balert(&#039;XSS!&#039;)//xxx/Result.xml?Command=DismissWhatsNew

Additionally, another less-likely injection point was found in a POST
parameter. This can be demonstrated in the UI by defining an SMTP server
and sending a test alert. The affected URL is as follows:

**Injection Point: HTTP POST Parameter**
* /Admin/XML/SMTPResult.xml (&#039;SMTPServer&#039; parameter)
