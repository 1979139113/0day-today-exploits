Advisory by Netsparker.
Name: Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in zTree v3
Affected Software : zTree
Affected Versions: v3.5.19.1 and possibly below
Vendor Homepage : https://github.com/zTree/zTree_v3
Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting
Severity : Important
Status : Fixed
CVE-ID : CVE-2015-7348
Netsparker Advisory Reference : NS-15-019

Description
--------------------
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack
a logged in user’s session. This means that the malicious hacker can change
the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim
while the hacker maintains access. As seen from the XSS example in this
article, if a web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting and the
administrator’s session is hijacked, the malicious hacker exploiting the
vulnerability will have full admin privileges on that web application.
