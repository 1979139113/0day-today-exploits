Vulnerability Details:

Risk:
Confidential data may get exposed to authenticated users (attackers). OX AppSuite user passwords are stored hashed and salted either using SHA1 or bcrypt, making it hard to gather plain-text passwords. However, other information like server configuration data, configuration files and database content could be extracted using this vulnerability. Even though the amount of returned data is limited to 30 characters for each request, this vulnerability can be used to subsequently gather more information by using scripts.

Steps to reproduce:

Possible solutions:
Update to the latest available version of OX AppSuite/OX6 backend.
Configure a web application firewall to mitigate such requests.
