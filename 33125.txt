
While this class is included in iMessage, it is more likely that this bug could be useful in local attacks.

To reproduce this issue:

1) Compile decodeleak.m

clang -o decodeleak -g decodeleak.m -fobjc-arc -framework CoreSuggestionsInternals -F/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks

2) Run:

./decodeleaks obj

leaked memory will be printed to the screen.
