Kaspersky 2010 Remote Memory Corruption / DoS PoC
=================================================


Description
============

The vulnerability affects Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 9.0.0.459
antivirus and its brother, the Kaspersky Antivirus 2010 9.0.0.463
version. The exploit was discovered on August 18th 2009. The problem
with these two antivirus versions appears when parsing a URL address.
Using a lot of consecutive dots inside the address.Kaspersky&#039;s native
avp.exe process will soar CPU usage up to 100%. At first, traffic via
the browser will get blocked, and eventually, if enough consecutive dots
have been passed inside the URL address, the computer will crash. This
exploit can be used inside HTML files, as normal href values or as img
image sources. It will also work inside HTML email bodies. The code can
be used remotely, and will lead to a Remote Memory
Corruption/Denial-of-Service that could alter computer hardware or
software.
