 
Problematic syscall in kernel_crashdump is:
 
open("/var/crash/linux-image-3.19.0-18-generic.0.crash", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC, 0666) = 30
...
open("/var/crash/vmcore.log", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE|O_CLOEXEC) = 31
 
Thus the output file is opened unconditionally and without O_EXCL or O_NOFOLLOW. Also opening of input file does not care about links.
