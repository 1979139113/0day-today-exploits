Product web page: http:/www.circutor.com
Affected version: PowerStudio SCADA 4.0.5 and OPC Server 1.4.1

Summary: CIRCUTOR&#039;s Electrical Energy Efficiency software (e3) is currently
called PowerStudio and encompasses all of the tools needed to manage your power
control equipment: from electricity, gas and water meters to reactive energy
compensation systems and powerful power analyzers.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting the
services &#039;CircutorPowerStudioScadaServer&#039; and &#039;CircutorPowerStudioServer&#039; for
Windows deployed as part of PowerStudio Series. This could potentially allow
an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the local
user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the
OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed during
application startup or reboot. If successful, the local userâ€™s code would execute
with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)
Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
