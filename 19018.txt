KeyPass Password Safe v1.22 - Software Filter Vulnerability

Introduction:
=============
KeePass is a very famous & free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. 
You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you 
only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. 
The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).

Details:
========
A software filter & validation vulnerability is detected in the KeyPass Password Manager v1.22 & older versions.
The bug allows an attacker (local) to implement/inject malicious script code when processing to export a manipulated
KeyPass Password Manager database. The vulnerability is located in the validation of the html/xml export 
function/module & the bound vulnerable domain/url (listing) parameter. URLs of entries are embedded in the exported 
HTML file without encoding XML special characters, when the URL (domain) field of an entry contains a malicious script 
code, this will be executed when the exported HTML file is opened in a browser.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilitiy requires a manipulated url with malicious script code, a logging server with chmod 777, a 
listing file (random) & an keypass v1.22 user. The bug will be injected on the local way, affects the local validation (html/xml) 
and change the technic back when remote transfering the password lists. The injection of the malicious url/domain context can be 
done via import (victim) or manually (reproduce)by including. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability lead to stable (persistent) 
context manipulation, persistent phishing, execution of malware or stealing plain password lists. Medium user inter action is required 
to exploit the vulnerability.

Normally KeyPass Password Manager exports the html backup with a secure clean template like ...

<th>URL</th><th>Password</th><th>Notes</th><th>UUID</th><th>Icon</th><th>Creation Time</th><th>Last Access</th>
<th>Last Modification</th><th>Expires</th><th>Attachment Description</th><th>Attachment</th></tr>
<tr><td>mypass category</td><td>my keypass test</td><td>asdfas</td><td>asd</td>


The local attacker manipulate the database with malicious strings (script code) in the category item profile name input fields.
KeyPass Password Manager generates the clean html template but after the persistent script code inject in the database
profile domain/url item, the persistent code is getting executed direct out the clean exported html template file.

<tr class=``MyAccountNameRow``>
 <td align=``right`` width=``150px``>Name des Benutzerkontos: </td>
 <td><b>``><[PERSISTENT SCRIPT CODE]`) <<=`` b=``></td>
</tr>



Vulnerable Section(s):
        [+] Export

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] HTML - XML 

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] URL (Domain)


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent script code inject & execution can only be exploited by local attackers. For demonstration or reproduce ...


Exploitation Scenario:
Attacker is sending the victim a manipulated login page with script code in the url parameters. The script code impacts 
an easy html or js script which responds to a url with chmod 777 (other server) to exchange of the file when processing 
a local request. The victim with keypass save the url or imports it via module (backup, xml & co). After some time the 
victim is exporting the file as html plain file with the keypass template. The script code of the url gets executed and 
transfers the context of the listed plain file directly to the attackers listening website script.

Solution:
=========
XML special characters in URLs (domain) need to be encoded when processing to export as HTML file.
