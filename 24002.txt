================
Software: WordPress
Version: 3.8.1,3.8.2,4.2.2
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Comment form CSRF in WordPress 4.2.2 allows admin impersonation via comments

Vulnerability
================
When posting comments,WordPress does not require a nonce value (unless posting unfiltered HTML). This means that an attacker can force a logged-in user to post arbitrary comments.
For this to happen, the logged-in user would have to be tricked into clicking on a link controlled by the attacker. It is easy to make these links very convincing.
The line which verifies the nonce when using unfiltered HTML is line 154 of wp-comments-post.php.

Proof of concept
================
Log in, visit an URL containing the following (replacing localhost as appropriate, replacing 1 with the ID of a post), click submit:
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-comments-post.php\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"comment_post_ID\" value=\"1\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"comment\" value=\"UH OH\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

(In a real attack the form can be made to auto-submit using Javascript)

Mitigations
================
Disable comments until a new version is released that fixes this bug
